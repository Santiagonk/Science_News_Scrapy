By stimulating one of those regions with electric current, scientists showed they can manipulate the placebo effect.

Mild electric zaps to the brain can  make that effect even stronger , scientists report online May 3 in  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  The finding raises the possibility of enhancing the power of expectations to improve treatments.\u00a0 This is the first study to boost placebo and blunt pain-inducing nocebo effects by altering brain activity, says Jian Kong, a pain researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital in Charlestown. The placebo effect arises when someone feels better after taking an inactive substance, like a sugar pill, because they expect the substance to help. The nocebo effect is the placebo\u2019s evil twin: A person feels worse after taking an inactive substance that they expect to have unpleasant effects. To play with people\u2019s expectations, Kong\u2019s team primed 81 participants for painful heat. The heat was delivered by a thermal stimulator to the forearm while participants lay in a functional MRI scanner. Each person received three creams, each to a different spot on their arms. One cream, participants were told, was a numbing lidocaine cream, one was a regular cream and one was a pain-increasing capsaicin cream. But in fact, all the creams were the same inert lotion, dyed different colors. Participants reported lower pain intensity from the heat on the \u201clidocaine\u201d patch of skin, an expected placebo effect. People also reported higher pain intensity on the \u201ccapsaicin\u201d skin, an expected nocebo effect. Before testing the placebo and nocebo effects, researchers had delivered electric currents to some participants\u2019 brains with a method called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. During these tDCS sessions, two electrodes attached to the scalp delivered weak electric current to the brain to change the behavior of brain cells.\u00a0 Some participants received tDCS targeted at a brain area thought to be important in placebo and nocebo effects, the  right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . Researchers used two types of current: positive anodal tDCS, which typically makes nerve cells more likely to fire off signals, and negative cathodal tDCS, which usually makes cells quieter. Compared with people who didn\u2019t receive tDCS, people who received cathodal tDCS reported stronger placebo effects when heat was applied to the skin with \u201clidocaine\u201d cream. For people who received anodal tDCS, the stimulation dampened the nocebo effect of the \u201ccapsaicin\u201d cream.\u00a0 Brain stimulation affected neural pathways that were already thought to be involved in the placebo and nocebo effects. Cathodal tDCS, for instance, boosted connections between the targeted brain area with a nearby area involved in emotion and cognition. \u00a0This strengthened pattern correlated with participants reporting a stronger placebo effect, Kong and his colleagues found. \u201cThis is a very elegant study and I\u2019m very excited and enthusiastic about it,\u201d says Luana Colloca, a neuroscientist at the University of Maryland Baltimore. Colloca, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, sees the potential to help  chronic pain patients  by ramping up the placebo effect ( SN: 9/13/18 ). \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet,\u201d she cautions. \u201cWe need to see if these same results can be replicated in patients with chronic pain.\u201d\u00a0 Kong agrees. His study was small, and people experience pain and placebos differently. \u201cBut I have to say, this is also encouraging,\u201d he says. "},

The movie begins with the rover\u2019s parachute opening above it as the rover and its landing gear enter the Martian atmosphere. Seconds later, a camera on the rover\u2019s underside shows the heat shield falling toward the ground. If you look carefully, you can see one of the springs that pushed the heat shield off the rover came loose, said NASA engineer Allen Chen, the rover\u2019s entry, descent and landing lead. \u201cThere\u2019s no danger to the spacecraft here, but it\u2019s something we didn\u2019t expect, and wouldn\u2019t have seen\u201d without the videos, he said. The rover filmed the ground coming closer and closer, getting glimpses of a river delta, craters, ripples and fractured terrain. Cameras on the top and bottom of the rover captured clouds of dust billowing as the rover\u2019s jetpack, the sky crane, lowered it down to the ground on three cables. A camera on the sky crane showed the rover swinging slightly as it descended. Finally, the sky crane disconnected the cables and flew away, leaving Perseverance to begin its mission. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to express how emotional it was and how exciting it was to everybody\u201d to see the movie for the first time, said deputy project manager Matt Wallace. \u201cEvery time we got something, people were overjoyed, giddy. They were like kids in a candy store.\u201d The movie looks so much like animations of the sky crane landing technique that NASA had released in the past that it almost doesn\u2019t look real, says imaging scientist Justin Maki. \u201cI can attest to, it\u2019s real,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning and it\u2019s real.\u201d The rover also captured audio from the surface of the Red Planet for the first time, including a gust of Martian wind. Perseverance  landed in an ancient lakebed called Jezero crater , about two kilometers from what looks like an ancient river delta feeding into the crater ( SN: 2/18/21 ). The rover\u2019s primary mission is to search for signs of past life and to cache rock samples for a future mission to return to Earth. The first images Perseverance sent back from Mars showed its wheels on a flat expanse. The ground is strewn with rocks that are shot through with holes, said deputy project scientist Katie Stack Morgan in a news briefing on February 19. \u201cDepending on the origins of the rocks, these holes could mean different things,\u201d she said. The science team thinks the holes could be from gases escaping volcanic rock as lava cooled, or from fluid moving through the rock and dissolving it away. \u201cBoth would be equally exciting for the team.\u201d "},

Once home to  lakes and rivers , Mars is now a frigid desert ( SN: 12/8/14 ). Scientists have typically blamed that on Mars\u2019 water  wafting out of the planet\u2019s atmosphere  into space ( SN: 11/12/20 ). But measurements of atmospheric water loss made by spacecraft like NASA\u2019s MAVEN orbiter are not enough to account for all of Mars\u2019 missing water \u2014 which was once so abundant it could have covered the whole planet in a sea up to 1,500 meters deep. That\u2019s more than half the volume of the Atlantic Ocean. Computer simulations of water moving through Mars\u2019 interior, surface and atmosphere now suggest that most of the  Red Planet\u2019s water molecules may have gotten lodged inside the crystal structures of minerals  in the planet\u2019s crust, researchers report online March 16 in  Science .\u00a0 The finding \u201chelps bring focus to a really important mechanism for water loss on Mars,\u201d says Kirsten Siebach, a planetary geologist at Rice University in Houston who was not involved in the work. \u201cWater getting locked up in crustal minerals may be equally important as water loss to space and could potentially be more important.\u201d Planetary scientist Eva Scheller of Caltech and colleagues simulated possible scenarios for water loss on Mars, based on observations of the Red Planet made by rovers and orbiting spacecraft, and lab analyses of Martian meteorites. These simulations accounted for possible water loss to space and into the planet\u2019s crust through bodies of water or groundwater interacting with rock. In order for the simulations to match how much water was on Mars 4 billion years ago, how much is left in polar ice caps today and the observed abundance of hydrogen in Mars\u2019 atmosphere, 30 to 99 percent of Mars\u2019 ancient water must be stashed away inside its crust. The rest was lost to space. Water gets locked inside minerals on Earth, too, says Scheller, who presented the results March 16 in a news conference at the virtual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. But unlike on Mars, that underground water is eventually belched back out into the atmosphere by volcanoes. That difference is important for understanding why one rocky planet may be lush and wet and habitable, while another is an arid wasteland.\u00a0 Mars\u2019 underground water could be mined by future explorers, says Jack Mustard, a planetary geologist at Brown University in Providence, R.I., not involved in the work. The most easily accessible water on Mars may be at its  polar ice caps  ( SN: 9/28/20 ). But \u201cto get the ice, you\u2019ve got to go up to [high latitudes] \u2014 kind of cold, harder to live there,\u201d Mustard says. If water can be extracted from minerals, it could support human colonies at warmer climes closer to the equator.\u00a0 "},

William Hartmann", "date": "March 19, 2021 at 10:30 am", "content": "Since its discovery, the interstellar object known as \u2018Oumuamua has defied explanation. First  spotted in 2017 , it has been called an asteroid, a comet and an alien spaceship ( SN: 10/27/17 ). But researchers think they finally have the mystery object pegged: It could be a shard of nitrogen ice  broken off a Pluto-like planet  orbiting another star. \u201cThe idea is pretty compelling,\u201d says Garrett Levine, an astronomer at Yale University not involved in the work. \u201cIt does a really good job of matching the observations.\u201d \u2018Oumuamua\u2019s origin has been a mystery because it looks  sort of like a comet, but not quite  ( SN: 12/18/17 ). After whipping by the sun, \u2018Oumuamua zoomed away slightly faster than gravity alone would allow. That happens when ices on the sunlit sides of comets vaporize, giving them a little rocketlike boost in speed. But unlike comets, \u2018Oumuamua didn\u2019t appear to have a tail from typical cometary ices, such as carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide, streaming off it. Alan Jackson and Steven Desch, planetary scientists at Arizona State University in Tempe, set out to discover what other kind of evaporating ice could give \u2018Oumuamua a big enough nudge to explain its movement. The pair reported their results March 17 at the virtual Lunar and Planetary Science Conference and in two studies published online March 16 in the  Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets . The amount of force that a vaporizing ice exerts on a comet depends on factors such as how much the ice heats up when it absorbs energy, the mass of its molecules and even the ice\u2019s crystal structure. By calculating the rocketlike push on \u2018Oumuamua if it were made of ices such as nitrogen, hydrogen and water, \u201cwe learned that nitrogen ice would work perfectly well,\u201d Desch says. Because nitrogen ice covers outer solar system bodies such as Pluto and Neptune\u2019s moon Triton, but not smaller objects like comets, \u2018Oumuamua is probably  a chip off a Pluto-like exoplanet , the researchers report. To determine how realistic that scenario is, Jackson and Desch calculated how many chunks of nitrogen ice could have been knocked off Pluto-like bodies in the early solar system. Back then, the Kuiper Belt of objects beyond Neptune was much more crowded than it is today, including thousands of Pluto-like bodies iced with nitrogen. But some 4 billion years ago, Neptune\u2019s orbit expanded. That disruption caused many Kuiper Belt objects to collide with each other, and most sailed out of the solar system altogether. Under such chaotic conditions, collisions could have broken  trillions of nitrogen ice fragments  off Pluto-like bodies, Jackson and Desch estimate. If other planetary systems throw out as many shards of ice, those objects could make up about 4 percent of the bodies in interstellar space. That would make seeing an object like \u2018Oumuamua mildly unusual but not exceptional, the researchers say. \u201cWhen I first started reading it, I was skeptical \u2026 but it does tick a lot of the necessary boxes,\u201d says Scott Sheppard, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, D.C. not involved in the work. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely plausible that this could be a fragment of an icy dwarf planet.\u201d But plausible, he notes, does not necessarily mean correct. \u2018Oumuamua is now too far away to confirm this idea with more observations. But the upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory and European Space Agency\u2019s Comet Interceptor mission could detect more interstellar objects, says Yun Zhang, a planetary scientist at C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur Observatory in Nice, France, not involved in the research. The Vera Rubin Observatory is expected to spot, on average, one interstellar visitor per year, and the Comet Interceptor spacecraft may actually visit one. Getting a closer look at more of these objects could narrow down which  possible explanations  for \u2018Oumuamua are most reasonable, she says ( SN: 2/27/19 ). "},

Perseverance is safely on the surface of Mars, ready to begin seeking the signs of past life,\u201d NASA engineer Swati Mohan said during a Feb. 18 livestream of the landing. The Perseverance team released some of the first images from the landing during a news briefing on February 19, including pictures of the Martian surface, the rover dangling below its landing gear and an action shot from another spacecraft orbiting Mars. This is the beginning of Perseverance\u2019s mission to explore an ancient river delta called Jezero crater, searching for\u00a0 signs of ancient life \u00a0and collecting rocks for a future mission to return to Earth ( SN: 7/28/20 ). The team released the first color image from Perseverance during the Feb. 19 briefing. \u201cAs soon as we got that color image, our chats just lit up with the scientists saying, look over here! Look over here!\u201d said deputy project scientist Katie Stack Morgan. \u201cWe\u2019re really doing science now on the surface of Mars.\u201d The rover  caps off a month of Mars  arrivals from space agencies around the world ( SN: 7/30/20 ). Perseverance joins Hope, the  first interplanetary mission from the United Arab Emirates , which successfully entered Mars orbit on February 9; and Tianwen-1, China\u2019s first Mars mission, which arrived on February 10 and will deploy a rover to the Martian surface in May. NASA  broadcast Perseverance\u2019s landing on YouTube  starting at 2:15 p.m. EST, with the moment of touchdown at approximately 3:55 p.m. on February 18. The rover used the landing system pioneered by its predecessor, Curiosity,  which has been exploring Mars since 2012  ( SN: 8/6/12 ). But in a first for Mars touchdowns, this rover recorded its own landing with dedicated cameras and a microphone. As the craft carrying Perseverance zoomed through the thin Martian atmosphere, three cameras looked up at the parachute slowing it down from supersonic speeds. When a rocket-powered \u201csky crane\u201d platform lowered the rover to the ground, a fourth camera on the platform recorded the rover\u2019s descent. Another camera on the rover looked back up at the platform, and a sixth camera looked at the ground. \u201cThe goal is to see the video and the action of getting from high up in the atmosphere down to the surface,\u201d says engineer David Gruel of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, who was the engineering lead for that six-camera system, called EDL-Cam. He hopes every engineer on the team has an image of the rover hanging below the descent stage as their computer desktop background six months from now. One of the images released February 19 could make that possible. The image shows the rover hanging from the sky crane platform. \u201cWhen we first saw this image, it was exhilarating,\u201d said strategic mission manager Pauline Hwang during the Feb. 19 press briefing. \u201cThe team went wild.\u201d Because it will take more than 11 minutes for signals to travel between Earth and Mars, the cameras didn\u2019t stream the landing movie in real time. And after Perseverance landed, engineers were focused on making sure the rover is healthy and able to collect science data, so the landing videos weren\u2019t among the first data sent back. Gruel expects to be able to share what the rover saw four days after landing, on February 22. Perseverance also carries microphones to record first-ever audio of a Mars landing. Unlike the landing cameras, the microphones will continue to work after touchdown, hopefully helping the engineering team keep track of the rover\u2019s health. Motors sound different when they get clogged with dust, for instance, Gruel says. The team will hear the sound of the rover\u2019s wheels crunching across the Martian surface, and maybe the sound of the wind blowing. \u201cAre we going to hear a dust devil? What might a dust devil sound like? Could we hear rocks rolling down a hill?\u201d Gruel asks. \u201cYou never know what we might stumble onto.\u201d Sound will add a way to share Mars with people who have trouble seeing, Gruel notes. \u201cIt might appeal to a whole other element of the population who might not have been able to experience past missions the same way,\u201d he says. Elsewhere on Mars, the  InSight lander  will be listening to the landing too ( SN: 2/24/20 ). The lander\u2019s seismometer  may be able to feel vibrations  when two tungsten weights that Perseverance carried to Mars for stability smack into the ground before the rover lands, geophysicist Benjamin Fernando of the University of Oxford and colleagues report in a paper posted December 3 to eartharxiv.org and submitted to  JGR Planets . \u201cNo one\u2019s ever tried to do this before,\u201d Fernando says. The ground will move by at most 0.1 nanometers per second, Fernando and colleagues calculated. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly small,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the seismometer is also incredibly sensitive.\u201d The team may be able to catch that tiny signal because they know exactly when and where the impact will happen. If the lander does pick up the signal, it will tell scientists something about how fast seismic waves travel through the ground, a clue to the details of Mars\u2019 interior structure. And even if they don\u2019t feel anything, that will put limits on the waves\u2019 speed. \u201cIt still teaches us something,\u201d Fernando says. The InSight team hopes to also feel vibrations from Tianwen-1 when its rover touches down in May. \u201cDetecting one would be great,\u201d Fernando says. \u201cDetecting two would be like, amazing.\u201d "},

With no electric charge and very\nlittle mass, neutrinos are known to blast across the cosmos at high energies.\nBut scientists have yet to fully track down how the particles get so juiced up. One potential source of energetic\nneutrinos is what\u2019s called a tidal disruption event. When a star gets too close\nto a supermassive black hole,  gravitational forces pull the star\napart  ( SN: 10/11/19 ). Some of the star\u2019s guts\nspiral toward the black hole, forming a hot pancake of gas called an accretion\ndisk before the black hole gobbles the gas up. Other bits of the doomed star\nare spewed outward. Scientists had predicted that such violent events might\nbeget energetic neutrinos like the one detected. Spotted on October 1, 2019, the little neutrino packed a punch: an energy of 200 trillion electron volts. That\u2019s about 30 times the energy of the protons in the most powerful human-made particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider. The neutrino\u2019s signature was picked up by IceCube, a detector frozen deep in the Antarctic ice. That detector senses light produced when neutrinos interact with the ice. When IceCube finds a high-energy\nneutrino, astronomers scour the sky for anything unusual in the direction from\nwhich the particle came, such as a short-lived flash of light, or transient, in\nthe sky. This time, astronomers with the Zwicky Transient Facility came up with\na possible match: a tidal disruption event called AT2019dsg. First observed in April 2019, that event\nhad been spied emitting light of various wavelengths: visible, ultraviolet,\nradio and X-rays. And the maelstrom was still raging when IceCube detected the\nneutrino, according to a team of physicists including  Marek\nKowalski  of the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron, or DESY, in Zeuthen,\nGermany. While intriguing, the association\nbetween the neutrino and the shredded star is not certain, says IceCube physicist\nFrancis Halzen of the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, who was not involved with the new study. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t know if I have to bet my wallet, but I probably would,\u201d Halzen says. \u201cBut\nit doesn\u2019t have much money in it.\u201d  The probability that a neutrino and a similar\ntidal disruption event would overlap by chance is only 0.2 percent, the\nresearchers report. But that doesn\u2019t meet physicists\u2019 stringent burden of proof.\n\u201cJust one event is difficult to convince [us] this source is really a neutrino\nemitter,\u201d says astrophysicist  Kohta Murase  of Penn\nState University. \u201cI am waiting for more data.\u201d Kowalski declined to comment for this\narticle, as the paper has not yet been accepted for publication in a scientific\njournal. To have birthed such an energetic\nneutrino, the star-shredding event must have first accelerated protons to high\nenergies. Those protons must then have crashed into other protons or photons (particles\nof light). That process produces other particles, called pions, that emit\nneutrinos as they decay. Now, scientists are aiming to pin down\nexactly how that acceleration happened. The protons might have been launched\nwithin a wind of debris that flowed outward in all directions. Or they could\nhave been accelerated in a powerful, geyserlike jet of matter and radiation. AT2019dsg shows some unusual features\nthat any explanation should be able to account for. X-rays produced in the event,\nfor example, appeared to drop off rapidly. So physicists WalterWinter of\nDESY and  Cecilia Lunardini  of Arizona State\nUniversity in Tempe suggest May 13 at arXiv.org that the event did produce a\njet, but that a cocoon of material gradually  shrouded\nthe  region, hiding the X-rays from view while still allowing the neutrino to escape. Lunardini declined to comment\nbecause the paper is not yet published in a journal. But Murase argues that for the jet to be\nhidden, that means it can\u2019t be that powerful of an outflow, making it hard to\nexplain the energetic neutrino this way. \u201cIf it injects a lot of energy, this\nenergy gets out,\u201d he says. In a third study posted May 18 at arXiv.org, Murase\nand colleagues favor the idea that the protons get accelerated in an  outward\nflowing wind or in a corona , a superhot\nregion near the black hole\u2019s accretion disk. Determining where these particles come\nfrom can help scientists better understand some of the most extreme\nenvironments in the cosmos. Previously, astronomers had matched up  a different energetic neutrino  with a blazar experiencing a flare-up ( SN: 7/12/18 ). A blazar is a bright source of light powered by a\nsupermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy. Both a blazar flare and a\ntidal disruption event \u201care very special activities, which is when a lot of\nenergy is released in a small amount of time,\u201d says astrophysicist  Ke Fang  of Stanford University, who was not involved\nwith the study. Making more observations of high-energy neutrinos\nis crucial, Fang says. \u201cThis is the only way we can clearly understand how the\nuniverse is operating at this extreme energy.\u201d "},

Determining\nthe neutron\u2019s lifetime is essential to understanding cosmic questions like  how certain elements formed after the Big Bang  ( SN: 5/9/18 ).

Scientists with the XENON1T experiment reported data June 17 showing an unexpectedly large number of blips within their detector. \u201cWe observe an excess \u2026 and we don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d said physicist Evan Shockley of the University of Chicago, who described the result  during a virtual seminar . The blips could be explained by  weird new particles called solar axions , or unexpected magnetic properties for certain known particles, neutrinos, the researchers propose. Or the excess might instead be the result of a more banal scenario: A tiny amount of radioactive tritium could have found its way into the detector. None of the possibilities would explain the nature of dark matter, an unseen substance in the universe that helps stars cling to their galaxies and explains how structures formed in the early universe. The XENON1T detector, located deep underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy, searched for interactions of dark matter particles within a large vessel filled with liquid xenon, running from 2016 to 2018. Until now, the researchers have  come up empty  ( SN: 5/28/18 ). But in the newest analysis of the data, they saw something unexpected. When looking for signs of electrons recoiling as other particles slammed into them, the team observed extra recoils of electrons at low energies, well beyond the number predicted by standard physics. Normal particle interactions should have produced around 232 electron recoils at low energy, but the researchers saw 285 \u2014 an excess of 53. \u201cThat\u2019s exciting,\u201d says theoretical physicist Dan Hooper of Fermilab in Batavia, Ill. \u201cBut sadly, I think it gets a little less exciting when you dig into it.\u201d That\u2019s because the most interesting explanations seem to be mostly ruled out by other types of measurements. The XENON1T team suggested that the low-energy events could be due to solar axions, hypothetical particles with no electric charge that could be produced in the sun. But if those particles exist, they would also stream out from other stars, taking energy with them and causing the stars to cool off faster than observations suggest. Another possible explanation for the extra events is impact from lightweight particles called neutrinos. If neutrinos have a magnetic moment \u2014 meaning that they act like tiny magnets \u2014 the particles would interact more strongly with electrons, resulting in more recoils. That explanation, likewise, is difficult to reconcile with what scientists observe in the cosmos, including how dead stars called white dwarfs cool. For either of those proposed explanations to work, there would have to be something not fully understood about the previous stellar-cooling observations. And neither possibility would explain the existence of dark matter. While other varieties of axions  could make up dark matter  ( SN: 4/9/18 ), XENON1T can detect only solar axions that would be too massive to fill that role. However, the existence of solar axions would help explain another long-standing puzzle of physics: why one force of nature, called the strong nuclear force, obeys a rule known as CP symmetry, unlike other interactions. Alternatively, the detector might contain a minute amount of tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen with two neutrons in its nucleus. That tritium could have been trapped within the materials that make up the detector, and may have slowly leaked out. When tritium atoms decay, they emit electrons, which could be responsible for the signature seen by XENON1T. This explanation wouldn\u2019t reveal anything new about the universe, but it would be the first time that a detector of this type was sensitive enough to spot such tiny amounts of tritium. For dark matter experiments that are searching for extremely feeble signatures, even that would be a step forward, Hooper says. \u201cThis is kind of what progress looks like.\u201d "},

Two sets of nuclear fusion reactions predominate in the sun\u2019s core and both produce the lightweight subatomic particles in abundance. Scientists had previously detected neutrinos from the most prevalent process. Now, for the first time, neutrinos from the second set of reactions have been spotted, researchers with the Borexino experiment said June 23 in a talk at the  Neutrino 2020 virtual meeting . \u201cWith this outcome, Borexino has completely unraveled the two processes powering the sun,\u201d said physicist Gioacchino Ranucci of Italy\u2019s National Institute for Nuclear Physics in Milan. In the sun\u2019s core, hydrogen fuses into helium in two ways. One, known as the proton-proton chain, is the source of about 99 percent of the star\u2019s energy. The other group of fusion reactions is the CNO cycle, for carbon, nitrogen and oxygen \u2014 elements that allow the reactions to proceed. Borexino had  previously spotted neutrinos  from the proton-proton chain ( SN: 9/1/14 ). But until now, neutrinos from the CNO cycle were MIA. \u201cThey\u2019re top of everybody\u2019s list to try and identify and to spot,\u201d says physicist Malcolm Fairbairn of King\u2019s College London. \u201cNow they think they\u2019ve spotted them, which is a major achievement, really an extremely difficult measurement to make.\u201d Located deep underground at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory in Italy, Borexino searches for flashes of light produced as neutrinos knock into electrons in a large vat of liquid. Researchers have spent years fine-tuning the experiment to detect the elusive neutrinos that herald the CNO cycle. Although difficult to observe, the particles are plentiful, Borexino confirmed. On Earth, around 700 million neutrinos from the sun\u2019s CNO cycle pass through a square centimeter each second, the researchers report. The result, presented for the first time at the virtual meeting, must still clear the hurdle of peer review in a scientific journal before it is fully official. Studying these particles could help reveal how much of the sun is composed of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, a property known as metallicity. That\u2019s because the rate at which CNO cycle neutrinos are produced depends on the sun\u2019s content of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. Different types of measurements currently disagree about the sun\u2019s metallicity, with one technique suggesting higher metallicity than another. In the future, more sensitive measurements of CNO neutrinos could help scientists disentangle the problem. The CNO cycle is even more important in stars heavier than the sun, where it is the main fusion process. Studying this cycle in the sun can help physicists understand the inner workings of other stars, says Zara Bagdasarian, a physicist at the University of California, Berkeley and a member of the Borexino Collaboration. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to understand how the sun works.\u201d "},

Physicists think they have detected the first conglomerate of four quarks incorporating more than two of the same kind. This tetraquark contains  four quarks of the charm variety : two charm quarks and their antimatter counterparts, called anticharm quarks, researchers report online at arXiv.org on June 30. Quarks \u2014 fundamental building blocks of matter \u2014 typically make up three-quark particles, like protons and neutrons, or quark-antiquark pairs, like pions and kaons. Physicists have observed some more exotic  quark quartets  ( SN: 4/11/14 ) and  even quintets  ( SN: 7/14/15 ). But the new four-quark particle, dubbed X(6900), is the first four-quark particle with all of the same type. Since charm quarks and their anticharm counterparts are among the heaviest types of quarks, it is also the first tetraquark to include more than two heavy quarks. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty exciting finding,\u201d says physicist Matthew Shepherd of Indiana University Bloomington, who wasn\u2019t involved in the work. Quarks are bound together by the strong force. Discovering new, exotic quark arrangements \u201ctells us something about the types of patterns of quarks that the strong interaction generates, which tells us something about the strong interaction,\u201d Shepherd says. A deeper knowledge of that fundamental force of nature could give insight not only into quirky particles like X(6900) but also common quark-based particles, like the protons and neutrons in atomic nuclei. Evidence of the new tetraquark was lurking in data collected from 2009 to 2018 at the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, near Geneva. In these experiments, physicists used the LHC to smash protons together and observe the particles forged in the collisions. The LHC data contained signatures of a particle with the mass expected for a quartet of charm quarks: around 6,900 million electron volts. That particle decayed into two J/psi particles, each containing a charm and an anticharm quark, suggesting it was originally a tetraquark with two charm and two anticharm quarks. Like other known tetraquarks, X(6900) could be either a single entity, composed of four quarks all tightly bundled together, or a pair of two-quark particles that are more loosely bound \u2014  like a set of atoms in a molecule  ( SN: 6/7/19 ). \u201cWe need to do many kinds of checks to confirm that it\u2019s really there,\u201d says study coauthor Liupan An, a particle physicist at the Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics in Florence. Those checks could include collecting more data with the LHC or seeing if other particle collision experiments produce similar results. Assuming that the evidence for this exotic quark cluster holds up, the strange new particle offers \u201ca sort of stress tester\u201d for ideas about how quarks construct matter, says study coauthor Chris Parkes, a physicist at the University of Manchester in England. He compares using this tetraquark for studying particle physics to biologists looking at extremophile creatures, like tardigrades, to understand the limits of biology \u2014 or to astronomers using  black holes to see whether theories about gravity hold up  in such intense environments ( SN: 4/16/20 ). It may be easier to study quark interactions in X(6900) than its other four-quark relatives, which contain lighter quarks, Shepherd says. That\u2019s because it\u2019s notoriously challenging to accurately predict the complex, fast-moving behavior of light quarks. When it comes to the four heavy quarks in X(6900), on the other hand, physicists could potentially build simpler models to predict quark behavior. "},

Katie Sowul/CDFW", "date": "March 29, 2021 at 8:00 am", "content": "Joshua Smith has been diving in kelp forests in Monterey Bay along the central coast of California since 2012. Back then, he says, things looked very different. Being underwater was like being in a redwood forest, where the kelp was like \u201ctowering tall cathedrals,\u201d says Smith, an ecologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Their tops were so lush that it was hard to maneuver a boat across them. No longer. The once expansive kelp forests are now a mosaic of thinner thickets interspersed with barrens colonized by sea urchins. And those sea urchins have so little to eat,  they aren\u2019t even worth the effort of hungry sea otters  \u2014 which usually keep urchins in check and help keep kelp forests healthy, Smith and his colleagues report March 8 in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . A similar scene is playing out farther north. A thick kelp forest once stretched 350 kilometers along the northern California coast. More than 95 percent of it has vanished since 2014, satellite imagery shows. Once covering about 210 hectares on average,  those forests have been reduced to a mere 10 hectares  scattered among a few small patches, Meredith McPherson, a marine biologist also at UC Santa Cruz, and her colleagues report March 5 in  Communications Biology . Like the barrens farther south, the remaining forests are now covered by purple sea urchins. Together, the two studies reveal the devastation of these once resilient ecosystems. But a deeper dive into the cascading effects of this loss may also provide clues to how at least some of these forests can bounce back. California\u2019s kelp forests, which provide a rich habitat for marine organisms, got hit by a double whammy of ecological disasters in the past decade, says UC Santa Cruz ecologist Mark Carr. He is a coauthor on the  Communications Biology  paper who has mentored both McPherson and Smith. First,  sea star wasting syndrome  wiped out local populations of sunflower sea stars ( Pycnopodia helianthoides ), which typically feed on urchins ( SN: 1/20/21 ). Without sea stars, purple sea urchins ( Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ) proliferated. The second wallop was  a marine heat wave so big and persistent  it was nicknamed \u201cThe Blob\u201d ( SN: 12/14/17 ). While kelp forests have been resilient to warming events before, this one was  so extreme it spiked temperatures  in many parts of the Pacific to 2 to 3 degrees Celsius above normal ( SN: 1/15/20 ). Kelp thrives in cold and nutrient rich water. As its growth slowed in the warmer water, less kelp drifted into the crevices of the reefs where sea urchins typically lurk. With a key predator gone and a newfound need to forage for food rather than waiting for it to come to them, urchins emerged and turned the remaining kelp into a giant buffet. For the northern California kelp forests, the shift could spell doom for two reasons. The dominant species growing there is bull kelp ( Nereocystis leutkeana ). It dies each winter to return again in the spring, and the changes are making it more difficult to bounce back year after year.\u00a0 In comparison, one of the main kelp species in Monterey Bay is giant kelp ( Macrocystis pyrifera ), which lives for many years, making it a bit more resilient. The kelp forests in the north also lack an urchin predator common farther south: sea otters. Those sea otters are what\u2019s providing a glimmer of hope in Monterey Bay. Smith and his colleagues wondered how the bonanza of sea urchins was affecting the otters. They found that sea otters were eating three times as many sea urchins as they were before 2014, but they were being picky. They avoided the more populous urchin barrens, instead feasting only on urchins in the remaining patches of kelp. That\u2019s because the barrens offer only a poor diet of scraps, leaving the urchins there essentially hollow on the inside. \u201cZombies,\u201d Smith calls them. The nutrient-rich urchins in the healthy kelp make a far better sea otter snack. And by zeroing in on those urchins, the otters keep the population in check, preventing urchins from scarfing up the remaining kelp. Simply transplanting sea otters to new locations may create new challenges. That\u2019s what happened off the Pacific Coast of Canada. Kelp forests there rebounded, but the  otters competed with humans , especially Indigenous communities, that rely on the same food sources ( SN: 6/11/20 ). \u201cThe community on the North Coast is a very natural resource\u2013dependent community, and this will impact them,\u201d says Marissa Baskett, an ecologist at the University of California, Davis. And there\u2019s a lot of work to do to figure out how to bring back sunflower sea stars, now a critically endangered species. Nailing down the cause of the wasting syndrome, which is still unknown, will be crucial to recovery efforts. Even so, understanding these interactions can provide clues to how to help restore the lost kelp forests, Baskett says. \u201cThese findings can inform restoration efforts aimed at recovering kelp forests and anticipating the effects of future marine heat waves.\u201d "},

For decades, physicists have realized that most of the universe\u2019s matter is nothing like earthly matter, which is made mostly from protons and neutrons. Gravitational influences on visible matter (stars and galaxies) indicate that some dark stuff of unknown identity pervades the cosmos. Ordinary matter accounts for less than 20 percent of the cosmic matter abundance. For unrelated reasons, theorists have also long suggested that nature possesses mysterious types of tiny particles predicted by a theoretical mathematical framework known as supersymmetry, or SUSY for short. Those particles would be massive by subatomic standards but would interact only weakly with other matter, and so are known as Weakly Interacting Massive particles, hence WIMPs. Of the many possible species of WIMPs, one (presumably the lightest one) should have the properties necessary to  explain the dark matter messing with the motion of stars and galaxies  ( SN: 12/27/12 ). Way back in the last century, searches began for WIMPs in an effort to demonstrate their existence and identify which species made up the dark matter. In 1998, one research team announced apparent success. An  experiment called DAMA  (for DArk MAtter, get it?), consisting of a particle detector buried under the Italian Alps, seemingly did detect particles with properties matching some physicists\u2019 expectations for a dark matter signal. It was a tricky experiment to perform, relying on the premise that space is full of swarms of WIMPs. A detector containing chunks of sodium iodide should give off a flash of light when hit by a WIMP. But other particles from natural radioactive substances would also produce flashes of light even if WIMPs are a myth. So the experimenters adopted a clever suggestion proposed earlier by physicists Katherine Freese, David Spergel and Andrzej Drukier, known formally as an annual modulation test. But let\u2019s just call it the June-December approach. As the Earth orbits the sun, the sun also moves, traveling around the Milky Way galaxy, carried by a spiral arm in the direction of the constellation Cygnus. If the galaxy really is full of WIMPs, the sun should be constantly plowing through them, generating a \u201cWIMP wind.\u201d (It\u2019s like the wind you feel if you stick your head out of the window of a moving car.) In June, the Earth\u2019s orbit moves it in the same direction as the sun\u2019s motion around the galaxy \u2014 into the wind. But in December, the Earth moves the opposite direction, away from the wind. So more WIMPs should be striking the Earth in June than in December. It\u2019s just like the way your car windshield smashes into more raindrops when driving forward than when going in reverse. At an astrophysics conference in Paris in December 1998, Pierluigi Belli of the DAMA team reported a clear signal (or at least a strong hint) that more particles arrived in June than December. (More precisely, the results showed an annual modulation in frequency of light flashes, peaking around June with a minimum in December.) The DAMA data indicated a WIMP weighing in at 59 billion electron volts, roughly 60 times the mass of a proton. But some experts had concerns about the DAMA team\u2019s data analysis. And other searches for WIMPs, with different detectors and strategies, should have found WIMPs if DAMA was right \u2014 but didn\u2019t. Still, DAMA persisted. An advanced version of the experiment, DAMA/LIBRA, continued to find the June-December disparity. Perhaps DAMA was more sensitive to WIMPs than other experiments. After all, the other searches did not duplicate DAMA\u2019s methods. Some used substances other than sodium iodide as a detecting material, or watched for slight temperature increases as a sign of a WIMP collision rather than flashes of light. For that matter, WIMPs might not be what theorists originally thought. DAMA initially reported 60 proton-mass WIMPs based on the belief that the WIMPs collided with iodine atoms. But later data suggested that perhaps the WIMPs were hitting sodium atoms, implying a much lighter WIMP mass \u2014 lighter than other experiments had been optimally designed to detect. Yet another possibility: Maybe trace amounts of the metallic element thallium (much heavier atoms than either iodine or sodium) had been the WIMP targets. But a  recent review  of that proposal found once again that the DAMA results could not be reconciled with the absence of a signal in other experiments. And now DAMA\u2019s hope for vindication has been further dashed by a new underground experiment, this one in Spain. Scientists with  the ANAIS collaboration  have repeated the June-December method with sodium iodide, in an effort to reproduce DAMA\u2019s results with the same method and materials. After three years of operation, the  ANAIS team reports  no sign of WIMPs. To be fair, the no-WIMP conclusion relies on a lot of seriously sophisticated technical analysis. It\u2019s not just a matter of counting light flashes. You have to collect rigorous data on the behavior of nine different sodium iodide modules. You have to correct for the presence of rare radioactive isotopes generated by cosmic ray collisions while the modules were still under construction. And then the statistical analysis needed to discern a winter-summer signal difference is not something you should try at home (unless you\u2019re fully versed in things like the least-square periodogram or the Lomb-Scargle technique). Plus, ANAIS it still going, with plans to collect two more years of data before issuing a final analysis. So the judgment on DAMA\u2019s WIMPs is not necessarily final. Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t look good for WIMPs, at least for the WIMPs motivated by belief in supersymmetry.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sadly for SUSY fans, searches for WIMPs from space are not the only bad news. Attempts to produce WIMPs in particle accelerators have also so far failed. Dark matter might just turn out to consist of some other kind of subatomic particle. If so, it would be a plot twist worthy of Agatha Christie, kind of like Poirot turning out to be the killer. For symmetry has long been physicists\u2019 most reliable friend, guiding many great successes, from Einstein\u2019s relativity theory to the standard model of particles and forces. Still, failure to find SUSY particles so far does not necessarily mean they don\u2019t exist. Supersymmetry just might be not as simple as it first seemed. And SUSY particles might just be harder to detect than scientists originally surmised. But if supersymmetry does turn out not to be so super, scientists might need to reflect on the ways that faith in symmetry can lead them astray. "},

After decades of searching, they aren\u2019t getting any younger. And they still haven\u2019t found what they\u2019re looking for. In this case, the object of the physicists\u2019 quest is SUSY. SUSY is not a real person or even a fountain relevant to aging in any way. It\u2019s a mathematical framework based on principles of symmetry that could help physicists better explain the mysteries of the universe. Many experts believe that particles predicted by SUSY are the weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs, that supposedly make up the invisible \u201cdark matter\u201d lurking throughout the cosmos. So far, though, SUSY has been something of a disappointment. Despite multiple heroic searches, SUSY has remained concealed from view. Maybe it is a mathematical mirage. If SUSY does turn out to be a myth, it won\u2019t be the first time that symmetry has led science on a wild WIMP chase. Reasoning from the symmetry of circular motion originally suggested the existence of a new form of matter out in space more than two millennia ago. Devotion to that symmetry blinded science to the true nature of the solar system and planetary motion for the next 19 centuries. You can blame Plato and Aristotle. In their day, ordinary matter supposedly consisted of four elements: earth, air, fire and water. Aristotle built an elaborate theory of motion based on those elements. He insisted that they naturally moved in straight lines; earth and water moving straight down (toward the center of the world), air and fire moving straight up. In the heavens, though, Aristotle noticed that motion appeared to be circular, as the stars rotated around the nighttime sky. \u201cOur eyes tell us that the heavens revolve in a circle,\u201d he wrote in  On the Heavens . Since the known four elements all moved in a straight line, Aristotle deduced that the heavens must consist of a fifth element, called aether \u2014 absent on Earth but predominant in space. Plato, on theoretical rather than observational grounds, had already insisted that circularity\u2019s symmetry signified perfection, and therefore circular motion should be required in the heavens. And so for centuries, the assumption that celestial motion must be circular held a stranglehold on natural philosophers attempting to understand of the universe. As late as the 16th century, Copernicus was willing to depose Aristotle\u2019s Earth from the middle of everything but still believed that the Earth and other planets revolved around the sun with a combination of circular motions. Another half century passed before Kepler established that planetary orbits are elliptical, not circular. Aristotle\u2019s belief in an exotic form of matter in space is not so different from the picture scientists paint of the heavens today, albeit in a rather more rigorous and sophisticated theoretical way. Dark matter predominates in space, astronomers believe; it is inferred to exist from gravitational effects altering the motions of stars and galaxies. And physicists have determined that the dark matter cannot (for various noncircular reasons) be made of the same ordinary matter found on Earth. SUSY particles have long been one of the most popular proposals for the identity of this cosmic dark matter, based on more complicated notions of symmetry than those available to Plato and Aristotle. And since the onset of the 20th century, symmetry math has generated an astounding string of scientific successes. From Einstein\u2019s relativity to the theory of elementary particles and forces, symmetry considerations now form the core of science\u2019s understanding of nature.\u00a0\u00a0 These mathematical forms of symmetry are more elaborate examples of symmetry as commonly understood: a change that leaves things looking like they did before. A perfectly symmetric face looks the same when a mirror swaps left with right. A perfect sphere\u2019s appearance is not altered when you rotate it to see the other side. Rotate a snowflake by any multiple of 60 degrees and you see the same snowflake. In a similar way, more sophisticated mathematical frameworks, known as symmetry groups, describe aspects of the physical world, such as time and space or the families of subatomic particles that make up matter or transmit forces. Symmetries in the equations of such math can even predict previously unknown phenomena. Symmetry in the equations describing subatomic particles, for instance, revealed that for each particle nature allowed an antimatter particle, with opposite electric charge. In fact, all the known ordinary matter and force particles fit neatly into the mathematical patterns described by symmetry groups. But none of those particles can explain the dark matter. SUSY particles as a dark matter possibility emerged in the 1970s and 1980s, when theorists proposed an even more advanced symmetry system. That math, called supersymmetry (hence SUSY), suggested the existence of a \u201csuper\u201d partner particle for each known particle: a force-particle partner for every matter particle, and a matter-particle partner for every force particle. It was an elegant concept mathematically, and it solved (or at least ameliorated) some other vexing theoretical problems. Plus, of the super partner particles it predicted, the lightest one (whichever one that was) seemed likely to be a perfect dark matter WIMP. Alas, efforts to detect WIMPs (which should be hitting the Earth all the time) have almost all failed to find any.  One experiment  that did claim a WIMP detection seems to be on shaky ground \u2014 a new experiment, using the same method and materials,  reports no such WIMP evidence . And attempts to produce SUSY particles in the world\u2019s most powerful particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, have also come up empty. Some physicists have therefore given up on SUSY. And perhaps supersymmetry has been as misleading as the Greek infatuation with circular motion. But the truth is that SUSY is not a theory that can be slain by a single experiment. It is a more nebulous mathematical notion, a framework within which many specific theories can be constructed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t really kill SUSY because it\u2019s not a thing,\u201d physicist Patrick Stengel of the International Higher School of Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italy, said at a conference in Washington, D.C., in 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s not an idea that you can kill. It\u2019s basically just a framework for a bunch of ideas.\u201d At the same conference, University of Texas at Austin physicist  Katherine Freese  pointed out that there was never any guarantee that the Large Hadron Collider would discover SUSY. \u201cEven before the LHC got built, there were a lot of people who said, well, it might not go to a high enough energy,\u201d she said. So SUSY may yet turn out to be an example of symmetry that leads physics to success. But just in case, physicists have pursued other dark matter possibilities. One old suggestion that has recently received renewed interest is a lightweight hypothetical particle  called an axion  ( SN: 3/24/20 ). Of course, if axions do exist, symmetry fans could still rejoice \u2014 the motivation for proposing the axion to begin with was resolving an issue  with yet another form of symmetry . "},

A new independent method to measure that rate could help cast the deciding vote. For the first time, astronomers calculated the Hubble constant \u2014 the rate at which the universe is expanding \u2014 from observations of cosmic flashes called fast radio bursts, or FRBs. While  the results are preliminary and the uncertainties are large , the technique could mature into a powerful tool for nailing down the elusive Hubble constant, researchers report April 12 at arXiv.org. Ultimately, if the uncertainties in the new method can be reduced, it could help settle the long-standing debate that holds  our understanding of the universe\u2019s physics  in the balance ( SN: 7/30/19 ). \u201cI see great promises in this measurement in the future, especially with the growing number of detected repeated FRBs,\u201d says Stanford University astronomer Simon Birrer, who was not involved with the new work. Astronomers typically measure the Hubble constant in two ways. One uses the cosmic microwave background, the light released shortly after the Big Bang, in the distant universe. The other uses supernovas and other stars in the nearby universe. These approaches currently disagree by a few percent. The new value from FRBs comes in at an expansion rate of about 62.3 kilometers per second for every megaparsec (about 3.3 million light-years). While lower than the other methods, it\u2019s tentatively closer to the value from the cosmic microwave background, or CMB. \u201cOur data agrees a little bit more with the CMB side of things compared to the supernova side, but the error bar is really big, so you can\u2019t really say anything,\u201d says Steffen Hagstotz, an astronomer at Stockholm University. Nonetheless, he says, \u201cI think fast radio bursts have the potential to be as accurate as the other methods.\u201d No one knows exactly what causes FRBs, though  eruptions from highly magnetic neutron stars  are one possible explanation  (SN: 6/4/20) . During the few milliseconds when FRBs blast out radio waves, their extreme brightness makes them visible across large cosmic distances, giving astronomers a way  to probe the space between galaxies  ( SN: 5/27/20 ). As an FRB signal travels through the dust and gas separating galaxies, it becomes scattered in a predictable way that causes some frequencies to arrive slightly later than others. The farther away the FRB, the more dispersed the signal. Using measurements of this dispersion, Hagstotz and colleagues estimated the distances to nine FRBs. Comparing those distances to the speeds at which the FRBs\u2019 host galaxies are receding from Earth, the team calculated the Hubble constant.  The largest error in the new method comes from not knowing precisely how the FRB signal disperses as it exits its home galaxy before entering intergalactic space, where the gas and dust content is better understood. With a few hundred FRBs, the team estimates that it could reduce the uncertainties and match the accuracy of other methods such as supernovas. \u201cIt\u2019s a first measurement, so not too surprising that the current results are not as constraining as other more matured probes,\u201d says Birrer. New FRB data might be coming soon. Many new radio observatories are coming online and larger surveys, such as ones proposed for the Square Kilometre Array, could discover tens to thousands of FRBs every night. Hagstotz expects there will sufficient FRBs with distance estimates in the next year or two to accurately determine the Hubble constant. Such FRB data could also help astronomers understand what\u2019s causing the bright outbursts. \u201cI am very excited about the new possibilities that we will have soon,\u201d Hagstotz says. \u201cIt\u2019s really just beginning.\u201d "},

Norton & Co., $27.95 On October 29, 1929, a date best remembered for the infamous Black Tuesday stock market crash, socialite and amateur bird watcher Rosalie Edge attended a meeting of the National Association of Audubon Societies. She was there to ask whether it was true, as a pamphlet had claimed, that the organization supported bounties on bald eagles in Alaska and turning wildlife refuges into shooting grounds. The men who led the organization were outraged that she brought up the issue. But the pamphlet revealed a truth about conservation at the time: The movement was not as much about saving species as it was about saving only certain species that people liked. And sometimes people only liked those species because they liked to kill them. The idea of conservation has evolved a lot over the last two centuries, as Michelle Nijhuis documents in her new book,  Beloved Beasts: Fighting for Life in an Age of Extinction . It was only in the mid-1700s that Carl Linnaeus began formalizing the idea of species. The recognition that a species could actually go extinct followed soon after. The push to prevent extinctions from happening came in the 1800s, with the realization that species such as the dodo had disappeared forever. Now we know that humans are driving such losses at a rate not seen for millions of years. Edge is just one of the many people who Nijhuis highlights in her excellent history. She includes famous names, such as Aldo Leopold, who in the early 20th century shaped the field of wildlife biology and whose writings have influenced generations, and Rachel Carson, whose 1962 book  Silent Spring  inspired huge changes to U.S. environmental laws and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. But it\u2019s Nijhuis\u2019 tales of lesser-known people, such as Edge and Michael Soul\u00e9, who is considered the father of conservation biology, that prove most fascinating. Their stories show how a single person can spark big changes, creating organizations and efforts that last for decades and grow to span the globe. The book truly shines, though, when Nijhuis is brutally honest about how the conservation movement gained a reputation for being antihuman. Prominent conservationists in the 19th and 20th centuries at times endorsed abhorrent practices, such as eugenics. But more often and more subtly, the movement has advocated for actions such as removing Indigenous communities from areas set aside for wildlife. Nijhuis also recognizes the need to move beyond worrying about saving eagles or any other single species. We must save whole ecosystems, all while balancing human needs, she writes. One example of such a holistic approach comes from Namibia, home to iconic animals like rhinos and giraffes, where conservation is not a top-down effort guided by governments or organizations with offices on the other side of the planet. It\u2019s carried out by dozens of local conservancies that consider the needs of both their local animals and their local people. Through detailed scrutiny, Nijhuis shows that Namibia\u2019s model is proving successful. Past methods of saving species, such as focusing solely on charismatic animals, won\u2019t halt what is now recognized by many as Earth\u2019s sixth mass extinction. But the book\u2019s focus on paths forward provides a bit of hope. That hope springs from collective action: We all must step up to save our planet\u2019s beloved beasts.

Fifteen years ago, the malacologist \u2014 or mollusk scientist \u2014 with the Australian Museum made an incredible discovery among the limestone outcrops there:  a tiny, 3-millimeter-long snail , with a ribbed, dark golden-brown shell, that was new to science. Subsequently named after her husband, Hugh Palethorpe, Palethorpe\u2019s pinwheel snail ( Rhophodon palethorpei ) \u201cis only known from a single location, at the Kunderang Brook limestone outcrops in Werrikimbe National Park,\u201d she says. Now it may become known for a different, more devastating distinction: It is one of hundreds of species that experts fear have been pushed close to, or right over, the precipice of extinction by the wildfires that blazed across more than 10 million hectares of southeastern Australia in the summer of 2019\u20132020. \u201cThis location was completely burnt,\u201d says Hyman, who is based in Sydney. \u201cWe expect the mortality at this site could be very high and \u2026 there is a possibility this species is extinct.\u201d A year after the last of the fires were doused, their toll on species is becoming increasingly clear.\u00a0Flames  devoured more than 20 percent of Australia\u2019s temperate forest cover , according to a February 2020 analysis in  Nature Climate Change . Even if plants and animals survived the flames,  their habitats may have been so changed  that their survival is at risk ( SN: 2/11/20 ). As a result of the scale of the disaster, experts say that more than 500 species of plants and animals may now be endangered \u2014 or even completely gone.\u00a0 Australia\u2019s iconic koala became the poster child of the crisis as images of rescuers carrying these singed marsupials out of the flames went global: As many as 60,000 of the nation\u2019s estimated population of 330,000 koalas perished in the fires, ecologists  concluded in December  in a report for World Wildlife Fund Australia. While there\u2019s no doubt that such charismatic megafauna suffered enormously, the greatest toll is likely to have been in other groups of species, such as invertebrates and plants, which often escape the public\u2019s attention. As Kingsley Dixon, an ecologist at Curtin University in Perth  told the Associated Press  last year: \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen a single event in Australia that has destroyed so much habitat and pushed so many creatures to the very brink of extinction.\u201d Even before the fires, many vertebrate species were already on downward trends, says John Woinarski, an ecologist at Charles Darwin University in Darwin. The blazes have \u201cexacerbated the threats that were driving the declines,\u201d he says. For example, fluffy arboreal marsupials called greater gliders ( Petauroides volans ) had already experienced a 50 percent population decline in recent decades. The fires then burned a third of their remaining habitat along Australia\u2019s eastern coastline. An ongoing assessment may lead to the gliders being recategorized from vulnerable to endangered. Overall, 49 vertebrates that previously were not endangered  now qualify for being listed as threatened  under Australia\u2019s guidelines for that designation, researchers reported in July in  Nature Ecology & Evolution.  That shift alone would increase the tally of nationally protected nonmarine vertebrate species by about 15 percent, from 324 to 373. Another 21 already threatened vertebrates had more than 30 percent of their ranges burned, and some may now qualify for being reassessed to higher categories of threat, the authors found. One species that may need to be recategorized is the koala ( Phascolarctos cinereus ), with some state\u2019s populations that were hardest hit under consideration to be upgraded from vulnerable to endangered.\u00a0 Besides the impact on koalas, the WWF Australia report suggests that as many as 3 billion individual mammals, birds, reptiles and frogs died or were displaced during the crisis. Though those figures are astounding, the impacts on lesser-studied groups such as invertebrates and plants may have been even greater. \u201cMany of those have much smaller ranges [than vertebrates], which means they are going to be even more impacted when a big fire goes through,\u201d says James Watson, a conservation scientist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane and an author of the  Nature Ecology & Evolution  paper on vertebrates. \u201cI am willing to bet that there\u2019s many species \u2026 that may disappear forever.\u201d In February, more than 100 biologists convened the first of several online workshops to assess whether 234 Australian invertebrates now need to be added to the International Union for Conservation of Nature\u2019s  Red List  \u2014 a global who\u2019s who of threatened species.\u00a0 Snails, similar to many invertebrates, are particularly susceptible to wildfires, as they are unable to outrun flames and can\u2019t survive intense heat, Hyman notes. Many also have small ranges that were completely incinerated, leaving no survivors that can recolonize the burned area. \u201cA snail can\u2019t do much to escape,\u201d she says. \u201cYou could expect more than 90 percent mortality in a high-intensity bushfire.\u201d In October, Hyman\u2019s team published one of the first papers quantifying the  impacts on invertebrates  in New South Wales in the  Technical Reports of the Australian Museum, Online . Their surveys showed that 29 species in the state \u2014 including dung beetles, freshwater crayfish, flies, snails and spiders \u2014 had their entire ranges burned. Another 46 species had at least half their known habitat within the fire zones. These 75 species were among the 234 under consideration for adding to the IUCN Red List during the biologists\u2019 first online workshop. \u201cWe\u2019ve gathered together 230-odd species that are believed to now be of concern. These include a range of different taxa from land snails to millipedes to arachnids to insects, and this 230 is growing rapidly,\u201d says Jess Marsh, an arachnologist at Charles Darwin University who was one of the conveners of the workshop. \u201cI expect it will massively increase.\u201d Some of the spiders she studies were the first to be added to that list. She\u2019s already spent several months on South Australia\u2019s Kangaroo Island  hunting without luck  for the Kangaroo Island assassin spider ( Zephyrarchaea austini ). Dependent on leaf litter suspended in the understory, and restricted to just a few locations that were razed in early 2020, she suspects that the species may be extinct. \u201cThere\u2019s no understory vegetation left, let alone any leaf litter suspended in it, so that species is really hanging in the balance,\u201d says Marsh. Generally, the species being considered for recognition as endangered had more than 50 percent of their ranges burned, lived in flammable parts of the habitat and have little ability to disperse to other areas. More than 150 of the 234 species being urgently assessed had their entire range burned. And it\u2019s not just the flames themselves that are problematic; so is the reshaped environment following fires. Millipedes, for example, are very vulnerable not only to fire but also to drying out in the reduced shade and shelter of the post-fire environment. \u201cA lot of invertebrates are very susceptible to desiccation, and need cover and humidity to survive a hot summer, which are obviously lacking following the fire,\u201d Marsh says. \u201cTaking into account all of the threats \u2026 we could be looking at significant numbers going extinct.\u201d Lost vegetation hasn\u2019t just put animals in danger. Many plants themselves may also be at risk, though experts have yet to compile an official list. Rachael Gallagher, a plant ecologist at Macquarie University in Sydney, has been  prioritizing endemic plant species  \u2014 those found nowhere else on Earth \u2014 that are in most urgent need of conservation for the Australian government. Perhaps surprisingly, she\u2019s particularly worried about some trees that actually depend on fire to survive. Eucalypts known as alpine ash ( Eucalyptus delegatensis ) and mountain ash ( E. regnans ), for instance, are typically killed by fire and then regenerate from surviving seeds in the aftermath. Australia has many trees that must  complete their entire life cycle  from germination through to reproductively mature adult before the next major bushfire passes through ( SN: 2/11/20 ). For some species, this may take 15 to 20 years. The problem now is that  climate change has increased the frequency of fires  to the degree that many of these plants are unable to reach adulthood and set seed before the next fire passes through, meaning they may be lost from these ecosystems ( SN: 3/4/20 ). The fires burned 25\u2013100 percent of the ranges of 257 species of plants for which \u201cthe historical intervals between fire events across their range are likely to be too short to allow them to effectively regenerate,\u201d Gallagher says. These species, which have some degree of fire tolerance, are at \u201cincreased risk of extinction.\u201d These include shrubs and trees such as the granite boronia ( Boronia granitica ), Forrester\u2019s bottlebrush ( Callistemon forresterae ), dwarf cypress pine ( Callitris oblonga ) and the Wolgan snow gum ( Eucalyptus gregsoniana ). Nevertheless, as researchers head out into the field to assess what\u2019s lost, what they are sometimes finding are glimmers of hope. \u201cAustralian plants are remarkably resilient and there\u2019s been regeneration in places where nobody thought there would be,\u201d Gallagher says. One species that survived against all the odds is the Gibraltar Range waratah ( Telopea aspera ), a drought-resistant shrub with leathery leaves and bright red flowers. \u201cThis species has a very small range, being specialized to granite outcrops in one mountain range, which was burnt during the fires,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, it has been noted as resprouting after the fires by park rangers and, in the absence of another fire in coming years, is likely to be able to recover.\u201d Several animal species that were thought to be in grave peril following the fires  that burned nearly half of the 4,400-square-kilometer Kangaroo Island  have survived better than expected too ( SN: 1/13/20 ). In the particularly badly burned reserves of the western end of the island, tiny marsupial carnivores called Kangaroo Island dunnarts ( Sminthopsis aitkeni ) are frequently appearing on camera traps. Swiftly erected predator-exclusion fences now protect survivors from feral cats. Similarly, large flocks of the glossy black-cockatoo ( Calyptorhynchus lathami ) have adapted by moving to unburned areas with food trees, says Karleah Berris of Natural Resources Kangaroo Island, who heads the crew that manages the endangered birds. Better news yet, a surprising number of birds bred and fledged young in mid-2020. \u201cThe important thing now is to protect what is left from fire until the burnt areas regenerate,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think, at present, all signs are that they are coping.\u201d Hyman says that, hearteningly, her team found handfuls of survivors of some snail species during several surveys in New South Wales in late 2020. The snails turned up in small patches of unburned habitat, sometimes at the bottom of gullies or in deep leaf litter around the bases of large trees. And that gives her hope that other snail species may have held on in other, larger unburned patches with greater numbers of survivors. \u201cBut the question then becomes, what sort of recovery can they make from that?\u201d she says. \u201cWhether they can recover and breed up and start to move back into surviving areas again perhaps depends on how dry the weather is in coming years and if there are more fires.\u201d She\u2019s still hoping that a handful of Palethorpe\u2019s pinwheel snails may have clung on against all the odds. \u201cMy husband is on tenterhooks wondering if his snail is still there or not,\u201d she says.

Dave-Carroll/iStock/Getty Images Plus", "date": "October 14, 2020 at 6:00 am", "content": " Venus flytrap\u2019s short-term \u201cmemory\u201d can last about 30 seconds. If an insect taps the plant\u2019s sensitive hairs only once, the trap remains still. But if the insect taps again within about half a minute, the carnivorous plant\u2019s leaves snap shut, ensnaring its prey. How Venus flytraps ( Dionaea muscipula ) remember that initial touch has been a mystery. A new study reveals that the plants  do so using calcium , researchers report online October 5 in  Nature Plants . Scientists know that some plants have a type of long-term memory, says study coauthor Mitsuyasu Hasebe, a biologist at the National Institute for Basic Biology in Okazaki, Japan. One example is vernalization, whereby plants remember long periods of winter cold as a signal to flower in the spring. But short-term memory is more enigmatic, and \u201cthis is the first direct evidence of the involvement of calcium,\u201d Hasebe says. Even though the carnivorous plant, famous for its jawlike leaves, has no brain or nervous system, it  can apparently count to five  and distinguish between live prey and things like rain, which could inadvertently trigger its leaves to snap shut, wasting energy ( SN: 1/24/16 ). Previous research suggested that calcium plays a role in this process, but with the help of genetic engineering, Hasebe and colleagues were able to actually see calcium in action. The researchers added genes to the Venus flytraps that produce a protein, which glows green when exposed to calcium. When the team tapped one of the trap\u2019s sensory hairs, the base of that hair began glowing, and then the glow spread through the leaf before beginning to fade. When the researchers touched the hair a second time \u2014 or touched a different hair on the leaf \u2014 within about 30 seconds, the trap\u2019s leaves lit up even brighter than before, and the plant quickly snapped shut. The results show that the flytrap\u2019s short-term memory is a waxing and waning of calcium within leaves\u2019 cells, the researchers say. Each time a sensory hair is triggered, it signals the release of calcium. When the calcium concentration reaches a certain level, achieved by that second, faster surge of calcium, the trap closes. Still, the research doesn\u2019t reveal all of the plant\u2019s secrets. To sense prey, \u201cthe flytrap operates a fast electrical network\u201d that can convert a fly or other insect\u2019s movement into small voltage changes that ripple across the plant\u2019s cells, says coauthor Rainer Hedrich, a biophysicist at the University of W\u00fcrzburg in Germany. Scientists are still unsure how the calcium memory system works in tandem with that electrical network to activate the plant\u2019s snap. \u201cThe close association of calcium and electrical signal is known in ordinary plants, so it was also expected in the Venus flytrap,\u201d says Andrej Pavlovi\u010d, a plant physiologist at Palack\u00fd University in Olomouc, Czech Republic who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. But the most interesting part of the research was getting the trap to glow, he says. Such genetic transformations are common in frequently studied plants, but more difficult to do in less well-studied predatory plants, so successfully engineering the flytrap\u2019s genes to make the plant glow \u201cis a great leap forward in studies on carnivorous plants.\u201d "},

Future Mars astronauts could grow crops in dirt to avoid solely relying on resupply missions, and to grow a greater amount and variety of food than with  hydroponics  alone ( SN: 11/4/11 ). But new lab experiments suggest that growing food on the Red Planet will be a lot more complicated than  simply planting crops with poop  ( SN: 9/22/15 ). Researchers planted lettuce and the weed  Arabidopsis thaliana  in three kinds of fake Mars dirt. Two were made from materials mined in Hawaii or the Mojave Desert that look like dirt on Mars. To mimic the makeup of the Martian surface even more closely, the third was made from scratch using volcanic rock, clays, salts and other chemical ingredients that NASA\u2019s  Curiosity rover  has seen on the Red Planet ( SN: 1/31/19 ). While both lettuce and  A. thaliana  survived in the Marslike natural soils,  neither could grow in the synthetic dirt , researchers report in the upcoming Jan. 15  Icarus . \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising at all that as you get [dirt] that\u2019s more and more accurate, closer to Mars, that it gets harder and harder for plants to grow in it,\u201d says planetary scientist Kevin Cannon of the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colo., who helped make the synthetic Mars dirt but wasn\u2019t involved in the new study. Soil on Earth is full of microbes and other organic matter that helps plants grow, but Mars dirt is basically crushed rock. The new result \u201ctells you that if you want to grow plants on Mars using soil, you\u2019re going to have to put in a lot of work to transform that material into something that plants can grow in,\u201d Cannon says. Biochemist Andrew Palmer and colleagues at the Florida Institute of Technology in Melbourne planted lettuce and  A. thaliana  seeds in imitation Mars dirt under controlled lighting and temperature indoors, just as astronauts would on Mars. The plants were cultivated at 22\u00b0 Celsius and about 70 percent humidity. Seeds of both species germinated and grew in dirt mined from Hawaii or the Mojave Desert, as long as the plants were fertilized with a cocktail of nitrogen, potassium, calcium and other nutrients. No seeds of either species could germinate in the synthetic dirt, so \u201cwe would grow up plants under hydroponic-like conditions, and then we would transfer them\u201d to the artificial dirt, Palmer says. But even when given fertilizer, those seedlings died within a week of transplanting. Palmer\u2019s team suspected that the problem with the synthetic Mars dirt was its high pH, which was about 9.5. The two natural soils had pH levels around 7. When the researchers treated the synthetic dirt with sulfuric acid to lower the pH to 7.2, transplanted seedlings survived an extra week but ultimately died. The team also ran up against another problem: The original synthetic dirt recipe did not include calcium perchlorate, a toxic salt that recent observations suggest makes up to about 2 percent of the Martian surface. When Palmer\u2019s team added it at concentrations similar to those seen on Mars, neither lettuce nor  A. thaliana  grew at all in the dirt. \u201cThe perchlorate is a major problem\u201d for Martian farming, says Edward Guinan, an astrobiologist at Villanova University in Pennsylvania who was not involved in the work. But calcium perchlorate may not have to be a showstopper. \u201cThere are bacteria on Earth that enjoy perchlorates as a food,\u201d Guinan says. As the microbes eat the salt, they give off oxygen. If these bacteria were taken from Earth to Mars to munch on perchlorates in Martian dirt, Guinan imagines that the organisms could not only get rid of a toxic component of the dirt, but perhaps also help produce breathable oxygen for astronauts. What\u2019s more, the exact treatment required to make Martian dirt farmable may vary, depending on where astronauts make their homestead. \u201cIt probably depends where you land, what the geology and chemistry of the soil is going to be,\u201d Guinan says. To explore how that variety might affect future agricultural practices, geochemist Laura Fackrell of the University of Georgia in Athens and colleagues mixed up five new types of faux Mars dirt. The  recipes for these fake Martian materials , also reported in the Jan. 15  Icarus , are based on observations of Mars\u2019 surface from the Curiosity, Spirit and Opportunity rovers, as well as NASA\u2019s Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Each new artificial Mars dirt represents a mix of materials that could be found or made on the Red Planet. One is designed to represent the average composition across Mars, similar to the synthetic material created by Cannon\u2019s team. The other four varieties have slightly different makeups, such as dirt that is particularly rich in carbonates or sulfates. This collection \u201cexpands the palette of what we have available\u201d as test-beds for agricultural experiments, Fackrell says. She\u2019s now using her stock to run preliminary plant growth experiments. So far, a legume called moth bean, which has similar nutritional content to a soybean but is more drought resistant, has grown the best. \u201cBut they\u2019re not necessarily super healthy,\u201d Fackrell says. Future experiments could explore what nutrient cocktails help plants survive in the various fake Martian terrains. But this much is clear, Fackrell says: \u201cIt\u2019s not quite as easy as it looks in  The Martian .\u201d "},

A new study shows that these plant parasites take their cue to flower from their hosts. Svetlana Monyakova/iStock/Getty Images Plus", "date": "September 4, 2020 at 7:37 am", "content": " dodder plant begins its life looking like a tapeworm. The tiny plant, which will never grow leaves or roots, elongates in a spindly spiral. Round and round it swirls, searching for a host plant. When the dodder finds one, it latches on and infiltrates the host with tiny tubes that siphon off water and nutrients. The parasitic dodder grows, eventually covering its victim in a tangled, threadlike web of orange or yellow stems. Then, when the host plant flowers, so does the dodder, setting the stage for the sinister cycle to begin again. But that last part, reproduction, has remained a mystery. Normally, flowering plants use their leaves to sense when the environmental conditions are right to flower. So how does a parasitic plant with no leaves sense when to flower? By eavesdropping, a new study shows, using a chemical signal from the dodder\u2019s host as its own. Australian dodder plants ( Cuscuta australis ) absorb the chemical that triggers flowering, a protein called Flowering Locus T, or FT, from their hosts and  use it to flower synchronously , researchers report August 31 in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . This synchronization maximizes the dodder\u2019s growth and reproduction, and may be part of why the plant parasite,  which consists of over 100 different species , has spread around the world, parasitizing organisms as different as alfalfa and acacia trees ( SN: 7/23/08 ). \u201cSynchronizing flowering really makes sense for these plant parasites,\u201d says Jianqiang Wu, a botanist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences\u2019 Kunming Institute of Botany. If a dodder flowers too soon, it won\u2019t grow as large as it could have and will produce fewer seeds. Too late and its host may have already died, leaving the dodder with less nutrients to support flowering.\u00a0 Wu previously demonstrated that dodders  exchange many chemical signals with their hosts , and had a hunch that the parasites might be picking up on a flowering signal from hosts. So in a laboratory greenhouse, the researchers let three species of dodders loose on plants with different flowering times, confirming that all the parasites shifted their flowering time to match their hosts. When the researchers experimentally disabled a host\u2019s FT gene, dodders no longer flowered. Then, the team attached a fluorescent protein to the host\u2019s flowering protein and saw it glow in Australian dodder tissues, confirming that the parasites were taking up the chemical cue. The flowering protein also interacted with flowering-related genes in the dodders, which the researchers say is further evidence that FT kick-starts the whole process. \u201cDodder and host plant synchronization has never been so clearly shown as in this paper,\u201d says James Westwood, a plant pathologist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. But there might still be more to the story, he says.\u00a0\u201cThere are examples of  dodders flowering when their host isn\u2019t flowering ,\u201d he says, so it remains unclear whether the parasites sometimes use other signals to flower.\u00a0 If it turns out that dodders truly use only FT from hosts to induce flowering, Westwood says that would be a simple and elegant example of how evolution has entwined plant parasites with the organisms they depend on for survival. But he thinks more research is needed. \u201cBiology is rarely that simple.\u201d "},

Brett A. McGuire", "date": "March 22, 2021 at 8:00 am", "content": "Complex carbon-bearing molecules that could help explain how life got started have been identified in space for the first time. These molecules, called polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAHs, consist of several linked hexagonal rings of carbon with hydrogen atoms at the edges. Astronomers have suspected for decades that these molecules are abundant in space, but none had been directly spotted before. Simpler molecules with a single ring of carbon have been seen before. But \u201cwe\u2019re now excited to see that  we\u2019re able to detect these larger PAHs  for the first time in space,\u201d says astrochemist Brett McGuire of MIT, whose team reports the discovery in the March 19  Science . Studying these molecules and others like them could help scientists understand how the chemical precursors to life might get started in space. \u201cCarbon is such a fundamental part of chemical reactions, especially reactions leading to life\u2019s essential molecules,\u201d McGuire says. \u201cThis is our window into a huge reservoir of them.\u201d Since the 1980s, astronomers have seen a mysterious infrared glow coming from spots within our galaxy and others. Many suspected that the glow comes from PAHs, but could not identify a specific source. The signals from several different PAHs overlap too much to tease any one of them apart, like a choir blending so well, the ear can\u2019t pick out individual voices. Instead of searching the infrared signals for a single voice, McGuire and colleagues turned to radio waves, where different PAHs sing different songs. The team trained the powerful Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia on TMC-1, a dark cloud about 430 light-years from Earth near the constellation Taurus. Previously, McGuire had discovered that  the cloud contains benzonitrile , a molecule made of a single carbon ring ( SN: 10/2/19 ). So he thought it was a good place to look for more complicated molecules. The team detected 1- and 2-cyanonaphthalene, two-ringed molecules with 11 carbons, seven hydrogens and a nitrogen atom. The concentration is fairly diffuse, McGuire says: \u201cIf you filled the inside of your average compact car with [gas from] TMC-1, you\u2019d have less than 10 molecules of each PAH we detected.\u201d But it was a lot more than the team expected. The cloud contains between 100,000 and one million times more PAHs than theoretical models predict it should. \u201cIt\u2019s insane, that\u2019s way too much,\u201d McGuire says. There are two ways that PAHs are thought to form in space: out of the ashes of dead stars or by direct chemical reactions in interstellar space. Since TMC-1 is just beginning to form stars, McGuire expected that any PAHs it contains ought to have been built by direct chemical reactions in space. But that scenario can\u2019t account for all the PAH molecules the team found. There\u2019s too much to be explained easily by stellar ash, too. That means something is probably missing from astrochemists\u2019 theories of how PAHs can form in space. \u201cWe\u2019re working in uncharted territory here,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is exciting.\u201d Identifying PAHs in space is \u201ca big thing,\u201d says astrochemist Alessandra Ricca of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., who was not involved in the new study. The work \u201cis the first one that has shown that these PAH molecules actually do exist in space,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore, it was just a hypothesis.\u201d Ricca\u2019s group is working on a database of infrared PAH signals that the James Webb Space Telescope, slated to launch in October, can look for. \u201cAll this is going to be very helpful for JWST and the research on carbon in the universe,\u201d she says.

EHT collaboration", "date": "March 24, 2021 at 10:00 am", "content": "onomers have gotten their first glimpse of the magnetic fields tangled around a black hole. The Event Horizon Telescope has unveiled  the magnetism of the hot, glowing gas  around the supermassive black hole at the heart of galaxy M87, researchers report in two studies published online March 24 in the  Astrophysical Journal Letters . These magnetic fields are thought to play a crucial role in how the black hole scarfs down matter and  launches powerful plasma jets  thousands of light-years into space ( SN: 3/29/19 ). \u201cWe\u2019ve known for decades that jets are in some sense powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes, and that the in-spiraling gas and the outflowing plasma are highly magnetized \u2014 but there was a lot of uncertainty in the exact details,\u201d says Eileen Meyer, an astrophysicist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County not involved in the work. \u201cThe magnetic field structure of the plasma near the event horizon [of a black hole] is a completely new piece of information.\u201d The supermassive black hole inside M87 was the  first black hole to get its picture taken  ( SN: 4/10/19 ). That image showed the black hole\u2019s shadow against its accretion disk \u2014 the bright eddy of superhot gas spiraling around the black hole\u2019s dark center. It was created using observations taken in April 2017 by a global network of observatories, which collectively  form one virtual, Earth-sized radio dish  called the Event Horizon Telescope ( SN: 4/10/19 ). The new analysis uses the same observations. But unlike the black hole\u2019s initial portrait, the new image accounts for the polarization of the light waves emitted by gas around the black hole. Polarization measures a light wave\u2019s orientation \u2014 whether it wiggles up and down, left and right or at an angle \u2014 and can be affected by the magnetic field where the light originated. So, by  mapping the polarization of light  around the edge of M87\u2019s black hole, researchers were able to trace the structure of the underlying magnetic fields. The team found evidence that some magnetic fields loop around the black hole along with the disk of material swirling into it. That\u2019s to be expected because \u201cwhen gas is rotating, it\u2019s basically able to carry along the magnetic field with it,\u201d says Jason Dexter, an astrophysicist at the University of Colorado Boulder. But, he says, \u201cthere\u2019s some interesting component of this magnetic field which is not just following the motion of the gas.\u201d At least some of the magnetic field lines are sticking up or down perpendicularly from the accretion disk, or pointing directly toward or away from the black hole, Dexter and colleagues found. These magnetic fields must be very strong to resist being dragged around by the whirl of infalling gas, he says. Such strong magnetic fields may actually push back against some of the material spiraling in toward the black hole, helping it resist gravity\u2019s pull, says study coauthor Monika Mo\u015bcibrodzka, an astrophysicist at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. Magnetic fields pointed up and down from the accretion disk could also help launch the black hole\u2019s plasma jets, by channeling material toward the black hole\u2019s poles and giving it a boost in speed, she says.

Strange radio emissions from a distant galaxy cluster take the shape of a gigantic jellyfish, complete with head and tentacles. Moreover, the cosmic jellyfish emits  only the lowest radio frequencies  and can\u2019t be detected at higher frequencies. The unusual shape and radio spectrum tell a tale of intergalactic gas washing over galaxies and gently revving up electrons spewed out by gargantuan black holes long ago, researchers report in the March 10  Astrophysical Journal . Spanning 1.2 million light-years, the strange entity lies in Abell 2877, a cluster of galaxies 340 million light-years from Earth. Researchers have dubbed the object the USS Jellyfish, because of its ultra-steep spectrum, or USS, from low to high radio frequencies. \u201cThis is a source which is invisible to most of the radio telescopes that we have been using for the last 40 years,\u201d says Melanie Johnston-Hollitt, an astrophysicist at Curtin University in Perth, Australia. \u201cIt holds the record for dropping off the fastest\u201d with increasing radio frequency. Johnston-Hollitt\u2019s colleague Torrance Hodgson, a graduate student at Curtin, discovered the USS Jellyfish while analyzing data from the Murchison Widefield Array, a complex of radio telescopes in Australia that detect low-frequency radio waves. These radio waves are more than a meter long and correspond to photons, particles of light, with the lowest energies. Remarkably, the USS Jellyfish is about 30 times brighter at 87.5 megahertz \u2014 a frequency similar to that of an FM radio station \u2014 than at 185.5 MHz. \u201cThat is quite spectacular,\u201d says Reinout van Weeren, an astronomer at Leiden University in the Netherlands who was not involved with the work. \u201cIt is quite a neat result, because this is really extreme.\u201d The USS Jellyfish bears no relation to previously discovered jellyfish galaxies. \u201cThis is absolutely enormous compared to those other things,\u201d Johnston-Hollitt says. Indeed, jellyfish galaxies are a very different kettle of celestial fish. Although they also inhabit galaxy clusters, they are individual galaxies passing through hot gas in a cluster. The hot gas tears the galaxy\u2019s own gas out of it, creating a wake of tentacles. The much larger USS Jellyfish, on the other hand, appears to have formed when intergalactic gas and electrons interacted. Hodgson and his colleagues note that two galaxies in the Abell 2877 cluster coincide with the brightest patches of radio waves in the USS Jellyfish\u2019s head. These galaxies, the researchers say, probably have supermassive black holes at their centers. The team ran computer simulations and found that the black holes were probably accreting material some 2 billion years ago. As they did so, disks of hot gas formed around each of them, spewing huge jets of material into the surrounding galaxy cluster. This ejected material had electrons that whirled around magnetic fields at nearly the speed of light, so the electrons emitted radio waves. Over time, though, the electrons lost energy, and the most energetic electrons, which had been emitting the highest radio frequencies, faded the most. Then a wave of gas sloshed through the entire cluster, reaccelerating the electrons around the two galaxies. \u201cIt\u2019s a very gentle process,\u201d Johnston-Hollitt says. \u201cThe electrons don\u2019t get that much energy, which means they don\u2019t light up at high frequencies.\u201d Instead, the gentle gas wave caused electrons to emit radio waves with the lowest energies and frequencies, giving the USS Jellyfish the extreme spectrum it has today.

Now, scientists have shown that three factors can explain why certain groups of stars form such recognizable patterns. To replicate how humans perceive the celestial sphere, a team of researchers considered how the eye might travel randomly across this night sky. Human eyes tend to move in discrete jumps, called  saccades  ( SN: 10/31/11 ), from one point of interest to another. The team created a simulation that incorporated the distribution of lengths of those saccades, combined that with basic details of the night sky as seen from Earth \u2014 namely the apparent distances between neighboring stars and their brightnesses. The technique could reproduce individual constellations, such as Dorado, the dolphinfish.

Those reactions could raise temperatures within the star, setting off nuclear fusion \u2014 the merging of atomic nuclei \u2014 and generating  an enormous explosion  that destroys the star, two physicists calculate in a paper published March 29 in  Physical Review Letters . The effect is akin to a hydrogen bomb, a powerful thermonuclear weapon in which fission reactions trigger fusion, says Matt Caplan of Illinois State University in Normal. The scenario is still hypothetical, Caplan admits \u2014 more research is needed to determine if uranium snowflakes could really spur a stellar detonation. White dwarfs are already known to be explosion-prone: They\u2019re the source of blasts called type 1a supernovas. Typically, these explosions happen when a white dwarf  pulls matter off a companion star  ( SN: 3/23/16 ). The researchers\u2019 uranium snowflake proposal is an entirely new mechanism that might explain a small fraction of type 1a supernovas, without the need for another star. "},

Such galaxies are rare now because almost as soon as a galaxy initiates star formation, massive stars produce huge amounts of oxygen, which is the most abundant element in the cosmos after hydrogen and helium. Astronomers prize the few such galaxies found close to home because they offer a glimpse of what conditions were like  in the very early universe , before stars had made much oxygen ( SN: 8/7/19 ). The new galaxy\u2019s oxygen-to-hydrogen ratio \u2014 a standard measure of relative oxygen abundance in the cosmos \u2014 is  well under 2 percent of the sun\u2019s , researchers report in a paper to appear in the  Astrophysical Journal  and posted online March 22 at arXiv.org. \u201cIt is quite difficult to pick up such a rare object,\u201d says astrophysicist Takashi Kojima, who, along with colleagues, made the discovery while he was at the University of Tokyo. Named HSC J1631+4426, the record-breaking galaxy, found by using the Subaru Telescope in Hawaii, is 430 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Hercules. The galaxy is a dwarf, with far fewer stars to create oxygen than the Milky Way has. Those relatively few stars have given the runt just a pinch of oxygen: one oxygen atom for every 126,000 hydrogen atoms. That\u2019s only 1.2 to 1.6 percent of the oxygen level in the sun. \u201cAny new galaxy is good,\u201d says Trinh Thuan, an astronomer at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville who helped find  the previous champion  four years ago. \u201cWe\u2019re counting the number of [very oxygen-poor galaxies] in the palm of our hand.\u201d The new galaxy\u2019s oxygen-to-hydrogen ratio is 83 percent that of the previous record holder, J0811+4730, which is 620 million light-years away in the constellation Lynx. In HSC J1631+4426, Kojima and his colleagues also find odd abundances of another chemical element: iron. While the overall amount of iron in the galaxy is low, \u201cwe discovered that the iron-to-oxygen abundance ratio is surprisingly high,\u201d he says. The same pattern also appears in the oxygen-poor galaxy in Lynx. In contrast, ancient stars in the Milky Way usually have little iron relative to oxygen. That\u2019s because newborn stars get most of their iron from the explosions of long-lived stars. Those explosions had not occurred by the time the Milky Way\u2019s oldest stars formed. But in the two nearly pristine galaxies, the amount of iron relative to oxygen is as high as that of the sun, which acquired large amounts of both elements from previous generations of stars. \u201cThis is a very unusual pattern, and it\u2019s not obvious how to explain that,\u201d says Volker Bromm, an astrophysicist at the University of Texas at Austin who was not involved with the discovery. Just before Kojima earned his Ph.D. in 2020, he hit upon a possible explanation: High-mass stars in dense star clusters merged together to make stellar goliaths more than 300 times as massive as the sun. These superstars then exploded and showered their galactic homes with both iron and oxygen, leading to high iron-to-oxygen ratios in the two primitive galaxies as well as a source of what little oxygen exists there. No stars this massive are known to exist in the modern Milky Way. But Kojima says their presence in the two most oxygen-poor star-making galaxies suggests that primordial galaxies had them too. When the superstars died, they should have left behind  intermediate-mass black holes , which are more than 100 times as massive as the sun ( SN: 9/2/20 ). That\u2019s about 10 times as massive as typical black holes, which can form when bright stars die. Kojima\u2019s team sees evidence for these big black holes in the newly discovered galaxy. Gas swirling around such large black holes should get so hot it emits high-energy photons, or particles of light. Because of their high energy, these photons would tear electrons even from helium atoms, which cling tightly to their electrons, and turn the atoms into positively charged ions. Sure enough, the galaxy in Hercules emits a wavelength of blue light that comes from just such helium ions. The record-breaking galaxy is \u201can exciting preview of things to come,\u201d Bromm says. In coming years, he says,  enormous telescopes will open  that will find even more extreme galaxies ( SN: 1/10/20 ). \u201cThen we will have a wonderfully complementary way to learn about the early universe.\u201d "},

New measurements of the most massive known neutron star find that it has a surprisingly large diameter, suggesting that the matter within isn\u2019t as squishy as some theories predicted, physicists with the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer, or NICER, reported April 17 at a virtual meeting of the American Physical Society. When a dying star explodes, it can leave behind a memento: a remnant crammed with neutrons. These neutron stars are extraordinarily dense \u2014 like compressing Mount Everest into a teaspoon, said NICER astrophysicist Zaven Arzoumanian of NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what happens to matter when it\u2019s crushed to this extreme point.\u201d The more massive the neutron star, the more extreme the conditions in its core. Jammed together at tremendous densities, particles may form unusual states of matter. For example, particles known as quarks \u2014 usually contained within protons and neutrons \u2014 may roam freely in a neutron star\u2019s center. The core\u2019s composition determines its squeezability. For example, if quarks are free agents within the most massive neutron stars, the immense pressure will compress the neutron star\u2019s core more than if quarks remain within neutrons. Because of that compressibility, for neutron stars, more mass doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to a larger diameter. If neutron star matter is squishy, the objects could counterintuitively  shrink as they become more massive  ( SN: 8/12/20 ). To understand how neutron star innards respond to being put through the cosmic wringer, scientists used the X-ray telescope NICER aboard the International Space Station to estimate the diameters of rapidly spinning neutron stars called pulsars. In 2020, NICER  sized up a pulsar  with a mass about 1.4 times the sun\u2019s: It was about 26 kilometers wide ( SN: 1/3/20 ). Researchers have now gauged the girth of the heftiest confirmed neutron star, with about 2.1 times the mass of the sun. But the beefy neutron star\u2019s radius is about the same as its more lightweight compatriot\u2019s, according to two independent teams within the NICER collaboration. Combining NICER data with measurements from the European Space Agency\u2019s XMM-Newton satellite, one team found a diameter of  around 25 kilometers  while the other  estimated 27 kilometers , physicists reported in a news conference and in two talks at the meeting. Many theories predict that the more massive neutron star should have a radius that is smaller. \u201cThat it is not tells us that, in some sense, the matter inside neutron stars is not as squeezable as many people had predicted,\u201d said astrophysicist Cole Miller of the University of Maryland in College Park, who presented the second result. \u201cThis is a bit puzzling,\u201d said astrophysicist Sanjay Reddy of the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not involved in the research. The finding suggests that inside a neutron star, quarks are not confined within neutrons, but they still interact with one another strongly, rather than being free to roam about unencumbered, Reddy said. The measurements reveal another neutron star enigma. Pulsars emit beams of X-rays from two hot spots associated with the magnetic poles of the pulsar. According to the textbook picture, those beams should be emitted from opposite sides. But for both of the neutron stars measured by NICER, the hot spots were in the same hemisphere. \u201cIt implies that we have a somewhat complex magnetic field,\u201d said NICER astrophysicist Anna Watts of the University of Amsterdam, who presented the first team\u2019s result. \u201cYour beautiful cartoon of a pulsar \u2026 is for these two stars completely wrong.

The stars in the clusters are relatively young, only about 100,000 years old. \u201cI think of these as stars in utero,\u201d says Grace Wolf-Chase, an astronomer at the Planetary Science Institute who is based in Naperville, Ill. For comparison, the massive stars forming in the Orion nebula are about 3 million years old, and the middle-aged sun is 4.6 billion years old. Volunteers with the  Milky Way Project  first identified the objects while scouring pictures of the galaxy taken by the Spitzer Space Telescope. The now-defunct observatory saw the cosmos in infrared light, which let astronomers take a sort of stellar ultrasound \u201cto probe what\u2019s going on in these cold environments before the stars are actually born,\u201d says Wolf-Chase. Citizen scientists had been looking through these images for baby stars thought to be at least 10 times the mass of the sun that were blowing giant bubbles of ionized gas. A year or two into the project, some users began labeling certain objects with the tag #yellowballs\u00b8 because that\u2019s what they looked like in the false-color images. Between 2010 and 2015, the volunteers found 928 yellowballs. Wolf-Chase\u2019s team initially thought the balls represented early stage gas bubbles. But because yellowballs were a serendipitous discovery, the researchers knew they probably hadn\u2019t caught enough of them to definitively ID the objects. In 2016, the team asked Milky Way Project volunteers to find more. By the following year, the group had spotted more than 6,000 yellowballs. Wolf-Chase and colleagues compared about 500 of those balls to existing catalogs of star clusters and other structures to try to figure out what they were. \u201cNow we have a good answer: They\u2019re infant star clusters,\u201d Wolf-Chase says. The clusters blow ionized bubbles of their own, similar to the stellar bubbles blown by single young, big stars. Wolf-Chase hopes researchers will be able to use the work to pick out yellowballs with telescopes like the James Webb Space Telescope, which is due to launch in October, and figure out more about the balls\u2019 physical properties.

The trading ship bore a trove of gold and silver coins and other valuable materials. But to a team of archaeologists and biologists, the  Bom Jesus \u2019 most precious cargo was a haul of more than 100 elephant tusks \u2014 the largest archaeological cargo of African ivory ever discovered.\u00a0 Genetic and chemical analyses have now  traced those tusks  back to several distinct herds of forest elephants that once roamed West Africa. \u201cIt is by far the most detailed and comprehensive attempt to source [archaeological] elephant ivory,\u201d says Paul Lane, an archaeologist at the University of Cambridge not involved in the work. The new results, reported in the Feb. 8  Current Biology , give insight into historical African elephant populations and ivory trade networks.\u00a0 For having been lost at sea for nearly 500 years, the  Bom Jesus \u2019 ivory is incredibly well-preserved, says Alida de Flamingh, a molecular biologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. \u201cWhen the ship sank, the copper and lead ingots [stored above the tusks] kind of pushed the ivory down into the seabed,\u201d protecting the tusks from scattering and erosion. A frigid ocean current also runs through this region of the Atlantic. \u201cThat really cold current probably helped preserve the DNA that was in the tusks,\u201d de Flamingh says. \u00a0 She and her colleagues extracted DNA from 44 tusks. The genetic material revealed that all of that ivory came from African forest elephants ( Loxodonta cyclotis ) rather than their African savanna kin ( L. africana ). By comparing the ivory DNA with that of past and present African elephant populations with known origins, the team determined that the shipwrecked tusks belonged to elephants from at least 17 genetically distinct herds across West Africa \u2014 only four of which still exist. The other elephant lineages may have died out as a result of  hunting  or habitat destruction ( SN: 11/7/16 ). The types, or isotopes, of carbon and nitrogen in the tusks provided more detail about where these elephants lived. Carbon and nitrogen accumulate in tusks over an elephant\u2019s lifetime through the food the animal eats and the water it drinks. Relative amounts of different carbon and nitrogen isotopes depend on whether an elephant spent most of its time in, say, a rainforest or an arid grassland. The isotopes in the  Bom Jesus  tusks revealed that these elephants lived in a mix of forests and savannas. \u201cWe were quite surprised,\u201d says study coauthor Ashley Coutu, an archaeologist at the University of Oxford. Modern African forest elephants are known to roam forests as well as savannas. But researchers thought that forest elephants first ventured out into grasslands only in the 20th century, as many savanna elephants were wiped out by poachers and the forest elephants\u2019 original habitats were destroyed by human development. The new results suggest that African forest elephants were amenable to both forest and savanna habitats all along. Better understanding the habitats historically preferred by African forest elephants could inform efforts to conserve  this vulnerable species  ( SN: 9/9/16 ). More than 60 percent of these elephants  have been poached within the last decade , and the ones that remain inhabit only about a quarter of their historical range, according to the African Wildlife Foundation.\u00a0 The origins of the  Bom Jesus \u2019 ivory also paint a clearer picture of the 16th century ivory trade on the African continent, Lane says. The fact that the tusks originated from many different herds hints that multiple communities in West Africa were involved in supplying the ivory. But it\u2019s unclear whether Portuguese traders gathered this diverse ivory from several locally sourced ports along the coast, or from a single port that was linked to extensive trading networks within the continent, Lane says. Future analyses of ivory uncovered at historical port sites could help solve the mystery. "},

On the ceiling of a small chamber in another Sulawesi cave, the researchers found a large pig painting \u2014 like the others, executed in red or dark red and purple mineral pigments \u2014 that dates to between 32,000 and 73,400 years ago. At least two other poorly preserved paintings of unidentified animals are located on the chamber\u2019s ceiling and wall. The team considers it likely that  Homo sapiens , rather than a closely related species such as  Homo floresiensis  ( SN: 6/8/16 ), painted on the Sulawesi cave walls. Like  a painted hunting scene from at least 43,900 years ago  previously found in a separate Sulawesi cave ( SN: 12/11/19 ), minimum age estimates for the pig paintings are based on measures of radioactive uranium\u2019s decay in cauliflower-like mineral growths that formed in thin layers over and underneath parts of the depictions. Uranium-based dating of ancient cave art  has drawn criticism  ( SN: 10/28/19 ). For instance, Brumm\u2019s group dated three mineral layers partly covering one of the pig paintings to estimate its minimum age. The layer closest to the painting was slightly younger than the two layers above it, the opposite of what would be expected if the layers had formed one after the other. Those topsy-turvy dates raise doubts about the accuracy of the painting\u2019s minimum age, says archaeologist Jo\u00e3o Zilh\u00e3o of the University of Barcelona. A mix of slightly older and younger age estimates can result from gaps that form in successive mineral layers, Brumm\u2019s team says. Averaging the dates of multiple layers provides a reasonable, possibly understated minimum age estimate for the underlying art, the researchers contend. Ultimately, cave art such as the pigs on islands in Southeast Asia and Australia, and probably Sulawesi as well, may be shown to date to as early as around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago, says archaeologist Peter Veth of the University of Western Australia in Perth. That\u2019s when  H. sapiens  first settled the region, probably bringing mainland cave art traditions with them rather than suddenly inventing the practice on isolated islands, he suggests. "},

Griffin", "date": "August 19, 2020 at 2:00 pm", "content": "Grimaces, scowls and doting gazes of ancient human sculptures indicate that there are universal facial expressions that signal the same emotions across cultures, researchers argue. Faces depicted in sculptures crafted between 3,500 and 600 years ago in Mexico and Central America convey five varieties of emotion to Westerners today, say computational neuroscientist Alan Cowen and psychologist Dacher Keltner, both of the University of California, Berkeley. Present-day folks, and likely members of ancient American societies as well, anticipate that each of  these emotional expressions occurs in particular social situations , the scientists report August 19 in  Science Advances . As participants in the new study predicted just by looking at the faces of sculpted individuals, pain expressions characterized sculptures of people being tortured, expressions combining determination and strain accompanied heavy lifting, angry faces occurred in combat, elated expressions appeared in people being held or embraced and sad faces typified individuals in defeat. That link between ancient and modern groups \u201cprovides strong support for universality and genetic origins of these [particular] emotion expressions,\u201d says psychologist Jessica Tracy of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. Cowen and Keltner regard their findings as a preliminary glimpse of how people who lived long ago, and who had no exposure to any modern culture, expressed certain emotions with their faces as Westerners now do. Researchers have argued for decades about whether certain facial expressions have evolved to express specific emotions, such as happiness, anger and disgust, regardless of one\u2019s culture. Previous comparisons of facial expressions across different modern societies have been complicated by the fact that people everywhere, including hunter-gatherers, have to some extent encountered Westerners and been influenced by their cultural practices. By looking deep into the past, the new study gets around that problem, the researchers say. The investigators first identified 63 ancient American sculptures from museum collections portraying people in eight situations \u2014 being held captive, being tortured, carrying a heavy object, embracing someone, holding a baby, preparing to fight, playing a ballgame and playing music. Sculptures came from ancient societies that included  the Olmec and the Maya  ( SN: 6/3/20 ). A total of 325 English-speaking participants, averaging nearly 36 years old, viewed images of each sculpture\u2019s face without being able to see the rest of the sculpture or discern its context. Volunteers, recruited from  Amazon Mechanical Turk , Amazon\u2019s online hiring site, rated either the extent to which faces portrayed 30 emotions, such as awe and anger, or the extent to which faces displayed 13 broader emotional states, such as pleasantness and alertness. Another 114 participants rated the extent to which someone described in written accounts of each of the eight situations depicted by the sculptures would express the same 30 emotions or 13 emotional states. Sculptures\u2019 facial expressions generally aligned with what participants expected to see in each situation. On average, for example, facial expressions of pain and distress clustered among sculpted individuals shown being tortured, in line with what Westerners predicted would occur. These findings suggest that facial expressions have evolved to convey a richer variety of emotions than scientists have often assumed, Cowen says. For instance, a well-known  system that categorizes seven basic emotions  communicated by the same facial expressions in all cultures does not include expressions of pain and of the combination of determination and strain. Although Cowen and Keltner deserve credit for taking a novel approach to studying facial expressions, the results won\u2019t quell debate over whether certain expressions communicate the same meaning across cultures, says psychologist Deborah Roberson of the University of Essex in England. English speakers today hold consistent assumptions about how emotional facial expressions should be deployed, as the new study shows, Roberson says. But ancient American cultures likely put distinctive spins on nonverbal emotional communication that researchers today may never be able to recognize, she contends. Yale University psychologist Maria Gendron agrees. Even today, emotional meanings of faces may not translate across cultures, she says. For instance,  Trobrianders of Papua New Guinea  perceive anger and threat in the same wide-eyed, gasping faces that Westerners view as expressions of fear. People living in small, relatively isolated communities, such as Himba farmers and herders in southern Africa, often rank facial emotions differently than Westerners do if asked to describe on their own what a facial expression shows, Roberson says. In such traditional societies, everybody knows each other well, so there is no need to assume that facial expressions reflect particular emotional states, she argues. \u201cIf someone is mean and grouchy most of the time, you are likely to be wary of them even when they\u2019re smiling.\u201d "},

Moffitt and Richie Poulton Harvard Univ., $35 Everyone has an opinion about what makes people, especially the troublemakers, who they are. Bad parents, bad genes, bad society, bad luck, bad decisions \u2014 pick your poison. Starting several decades ago, four psychologists decided to examine how individuals flourish or flounder over the long run. Instead of jumping into a seemingly endless academic scrum over \u201cnature versus nurture,\u201d they studied how children actually develop over years and decades. Jay Belsky, Avshalom Caspi, Terrie Moffitt and Richie Poulton describe provocative insights from their investigations in  The Origins of You . Developmental researchers acknowledge that many personal and social factors interact throughout life. No single factor can explain, say, why one person pursues a life of crime and another excels in college. Life events and random circumstances tug kids in different directions, making various outcomes more or less probable but never dictating outcomes, the authors emphasize. Only prospective studies can begin to illuminate the winding paths youngsters travel to become their adult selves. Much of  The Origins of You  concerns a project \u2014 now run by Caspi, Moffitt and Poulton \u2014 that has assessed about 1,000 New Zealanders in the town of Dunedin from birth to age 38 (data to age 45 is coming soon). The book also focuses on a study, started by Moffitt and Caspi, that has evaluated more than 1,000 pairs of British twins from ages 5 to 18, as well as another study, in which Belsky was involved, that followed about 1,300 U.S. children from birth to age 15. These investigations are among the few that have assessed a range of psychological and physical measures from childhood into adolescence and beyond. One intriguing finding from these studies suggests that only certain childhood temperaments influence teenage personality and behavior. Dunedin kids deemed \u201cundercontrolled,\u201d irritable and distractible, at age 3 were typically impulsive and danger-seeking at age 18. \u201cInhibited\u201d youngsters, however, tagged as shy, fearful and unresponsive to others at age 3, later were generally restrained and passive with others. Those two groups made up just 18 percent of the Dunedin sample. Children play an active part in shaping their social worlds, likely explaining in large part why these particular childhood temperaments were so closely aligned with later personality, the authors suggest. Long-term Dunedin data indicate, for instance, that undercontrolled kids provoked hostility in parents, peers and teachers. A vicious cycle of rejection by others played out in which undercontrolled youngsters never had opportunities to learn social skills and self-control. Inhibited children, in contrast, avoided chances to make friends in new situations and to stand out academically or socially in school. By young adulthood, these kids had no clue how to influence or lead others. For the remaining 82 percent of the Dunedin youngsters, the researchers found only weak links between age 3 temperament \u2014 say, being outgoing and confident or reserved but willing to interact with others \u2014 and personality 15 years later. In those cases, kids were able to connect with adults and peers throughout childhood regardless of temperament. Later in life, the undercontrolled 3-year-olds faced the worst prospects. Those individuals had volatile, unstable relationships with family, friends, romantic partners and coworkers by age 21; males in that group were especially likely to develop gambling problems by age 32. Other findings from the three studies cover a lot of ground. Consider the following: Good or bad parenting predicts how girls, but not boys, will relate as adults to their own 3-year-olds. Regular marijuana use starting in the teen years harms mental health far more than physical health. As physical abuse and other childhood adversities add up, individuals become more likely to suffer a rapid decline in many markers of biological age \u2014 including immune, kidney and heart function \u2014 by their 20s and to suffer from poor health by age 38. Refreshingly, the authors acknowledge that the science of human development is not advanced enough to make pronouncements about how to raise children. Disappointingly, the authors offer few peeks at their personal backgrounds and how they ended up doing what they do. Despite that gap, and the inability of these findings to address development in non-Western cultures, after finishing the book, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what will happen as these people, tracked since childhood, enter the second half of their lives.

Juanmonino/iStock/Getty Images Plus", "date": "November 2, 2020 at 6:00 am", "content": " 2015 wound down, a foreboding but catchy phrase from a scientific paper blew across the cultural landscape with unexpected force. The expression \u201cdeaths of despair\u201d was born after Princeton University economist Anne Case and Angus Deaton \u2014 Case\u2019s colleague, husband and a Nobel laureate in economics \u2014 dug into U.S. death statistics and found that, during the 1900s, people\u2019s life spans had generally lengthened from roughly 50 years to nearly 80. But then, near the end of the century, one segment of the population took a U-turn. Since the 1990s,  mortality had risen sharply  among middle-aged, non-Hispanic white people, especially those without a college degree, Case and Deaton reported in December 2015 in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . The reason, to a large extent: White, working-class people ages 45 to 54 were drinking themselves to death with alcohol, accidentally overdosing on opioids and other drugs, and killing themselves, often by shooting or hanging. Vanishing jobs, disintegrating families and other social stressors had unleashed a rising tide of fatal despair, Case and Deaton concluded. This disturbing trend mirrored what had previously occurred among inner-city Black people in the 1970s and 1980s, Case and Deaton now say. As low-skilled jobs vanished and families broke apart, Black victims of crack cocaine and the AIDS epidemic represented an early wave of deaths of despair. Even today, mortality rates for Black people still exceed those of white people in the United States for a variety of reasons, with Black overdose deaths on the rise over the last few years. \u201cThe most meaningful dividing line [for being at risk of deaths of despair] is whether or not you have a four-year college degree,\u201d Deaton says. But despair has no clear scientific or medical definition. Psychiatric disorders plausibly related to a sense of despair, such as major depression and anxiety disorders, have been studied for decades. Despair \u2014 derived from a Latin term meaning \u201cdown from hope\u201d \u2014 might be just another way to describe these conditions. Or it might be its own special form of suffering. Some researchers regard despair as a distinct psychological status \u2014 one that can potentially be traced back to early childhood and may pose a risk for suicide, illegal drug use and maybe even physical pain. For that reason, mental health clinicians need to work to distinguish despair from depression, even if despair isn\u2019t a disorder in psychiatry\u2019s diagnostic manual, says psychiatrist Ronald Pies of the State University of New York\u2019s Upstate Medical University in Syracuse. \u201cAn overreliance on what is sometimes called \u2018the Bible of psychiatry\u2019 is likely to be misleading or inadequate when assessing the risk of suicide and illicit drug use,\u201d he contends. What\u2019s more, recognizing and measuring despair, or something like it, as a state of mind separate from depressive disorders might shed light on the uptick in mental distress reported by people of all backgrounds during the coronavirus pandemic, Pies says. Developing a despair scale may also provide insights into those individuals most likely to succumb to despair-related fatalities. Long-term trends in national mortality data suggest that such deaths will continue to climb, even long after the viral calamity ends.\u00a0 Case and Deaton\u2019s emphasis on escalating 21st century deaths of despair \u2014 further detailed in their 2020 book  Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism  \u2014 hit a nerve, especially among  researchers studying groups of children  as they grow into adults. These developmental scientists are in a prime position to uncover the roots of deadly despair and identify how some individuals nurture hope during difficult times while others experience a toxic brew of mental pain. First, though, despair must be defined in a measurable way. In a study in the June  JAMA Network Open , researchers described a preliminary assessment of a tool that can be used  to estimate an individual\u2019s level of despair . To develop the tool, psychologist William Copeland of the University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine in Burlington and colleagues focused on youngsters living in mostly rural parts of western North Carolina, a section of Appalachia that has been devastated by opioid overdoses and other deaths of despair. Known as the Great Smoky Mountains Study, the research was launched in 1992 and has assessed mental health in 1,266 individuals as many as 12 times, from ages 9 to 13 up to age 30. Inspired by Case and Deaton\u2019s findings, Copeland\u2019s team looked at how despair has been defined in recent scientific studies and then reexamined the North Carolina data from a new perspective, identifying seven indicators of despair. Two indicators \u2014 feeling hopeless and having low self-esteem \u2014 are among the symptoms of persistent depressive disorder, a psychiatric condition consisting of a depressed mood that lasts for at least two years in adults. Another indicator \u2014 feeling unloved \u2014 is a symptom of major depression, a mental disorder characterized by bouts of overwhelming sadness and social isolation lasting at least two weeks. A fourth indicator \u2014 worrying frequently \u2014 contributes to what mental health clinicians call generalized anxiety disorder. The remaining three indicators \u2014 loneliness, helplessness and feeling sorry for oneself \u2014 are not symptoms of any psychiatric disorder. Combining those seven indicators into a despair scale let the researchers compare levels of despair among youngsters. Between 1 and 5 percent of children and teens in the study experienced at least one symptom on the scale in the three months before being interviewed, Copeland\u2019s group reported. Among 25- to 30-year-olds, about 20 percent reported one despair item, and 7.6 percent cited at least two despair items, in the previous three months. Few participants suffered from more than five of the seven despair indicators. Individuals who cited single despair items related to depression rarely qualified for a depressive disorder in psychiatry\u2019s diagnostic manual. Young adults\u2019 despair scores were generally higher among people who didn\u2019t get a college degree and among African Americans in general. Overall, 25- to 30-year-olds became increasingly likely to think about or attempt suicide and to abuse illicit drugs, including opioids, as they scored higher on the despair scale. These trends were especially strong among participants who had elevated despair scores that traced back to childhood. In contrast to Case and Deaton\u2019s national findings indicating that alcoholism contributes to deaths of despair, despair scores among participants displayed no link with alcohol abuse. Alcoholism is more widespread than suicide and opioid abuse, suggesting that excessive alcohol drinking stems from a wider range of stressful situations and personal problems than the other two behaviors do, Copeland says. As a result, any influence of despair on alcohol abuse may be difficult to pick up statistically. And though lower education levels were associated with higher despair scores, Copeland\u2019s team failed to find an elevated tendency of less-educated participants to become suicidal or abuse drugs. That finding deserves closer scrutiny in a nationally representative sample of young adults, not just rural North Carolinians, Deaton says. Further research also needs to expand the current despair scale to include other potential indicators of despair, such as sadness, recklessness and declining immune function, Copeland adds. Despair as measured by the new scale represents a downhearted state of mind, not a mental disorder, Copeland suspects. High despair scores predicted illicit drug abuse and suicidal thoughts and behaviors regardless of whether 25- to 30-year-olds qualified as depressed. Despair was not usually accompanied by depression, though depressed participants typically reported experiencing indicators of despair, such as being lonely. Scores on this instrument highlight growing concerns that a sense of despair contributes to self-destructive but not necessarily lethal behavior among people on the cusp of adulthood. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a large effect of despair on [some] young adults,\u201d Copeland says. \u201cIt makes their lives miserable.\u201d As for older adults, despair doesn\u2019t just fuel deaths among less-educated Americans, it may also sucker-punch these people into a world of physical pain, a recent study from Case, Deaton and psychologist Arthur Stone of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles suggests. By their own accounts, today\u2019s midlife Americans in their 40s and 50s  have already experienced more pain throughout life  than today\u2019s elderly Americans have over longer periods of time, the researchers report in the Oct. 6  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . And that trend has become increasingly pronounced over the last several decades among U.S. adults without college degrees. These findings come from four nationally representative samples and apply across racial and ethnic groups. In samples of adults studied every year from 1997 to 2018, participants increasingly reported frequent and intense lower-back pain, the researchers found. Weight gain over that time statistically accounts for only about one-quarter of the reported rise in lower-back pain, the researchers say, and so can\u2019t fully explain the pain. In other wealthy countries, the prevalence of physical pain reported by adults without a college degree increased by 4 percent between those born in 1950 and those born in 1990. In the United States, the increase was 21 percent, an analysis of data on self-reported physical pain from several national and international surveys shows. Deaths of despair have also increased to a much greater extent in the United States than in other Western nations, the researchers say. Like deaths of despair, reports of increasing pain by less-educated adults reflect a snowballing erosion of working-class life and rising levels of despair among those born after 1950, Case, Deaton and Stone speculate. In their new book, Case and Deaton present evidence for that argument based on trends in unemployment, losses of health insurance, out-of-wedlock births and other factors. \u201cThe mind-body connection is incredibly important,\u201d Case says. \u201cFeeling excluded and socially isolated can trigger physical pain.\u201d Despair also deserves close scrutiny as an unfortunate consequence of the coronavirus pandemic, Pies says. No one doubts that emotional suffering has accompanied COVID-19. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey published August 14 found that U.S. adults reported substantially  more symptoms of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder  in June 2020 than in April through June 2019. Reported symptoms of stress and trauma, as well as thoughts about suicide, also rose this year. About 10 percent of 5,140 survey participants said that COVID-19 caused them to start or increase drug use. Another national survey conducted from March 31 through April 13 found that  27.8 percent of the U.S. adult population reported depression symptoms , compared with 8.5 percent of U.S. adults surveyed in 2017 and 2018. These survey results appear in the September  JAMA Network Open . But increased psychiatric symptoms during the pandemic don\u2019t necessarily mean that more people are suffering from psychiatric disorders, Pies says. Self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms may not be long-lasting enough or impair daily functioning enough to be classed as mental disorders. And Copeland\u2019s findings on despair suggest that it may be too simplistic to assume that the pandemic has led to a widespread outbreak of depression and other mental disorders, Pies says. Instead, many emotional reactions to the pandemic detected in surveys may reflect  understandable demoralization and grief  at painful losses of jobs, social contacts and loved ones felled by the virus, Pies wrote August 24 in  Psychiatric Times . Demoralization, he says, involves experiencing a loss of meaning and purpose in life, accompanied by frustration, anger and a feeling that one is fighting a losing battle. That definition partly overlaps with Copeland\u2019s despair scale, Pies says. The extent to which demoralization and despair intersect is uncertain. How despair, depression and the pandemic may overlap is still fuzzy. But what is clear is that deaths of despair can\u2019t be blamed on mental disorders and can lead to real costs to society, Case and Deaton contend. And that won\u2019t end with a vaccine. \u201cDeaths of despair are a long-term phenomenon that will be with us after the COVID-19 crisis is over,\u201d Case says. "},

Manoj Shah/Stone/Getty Images Plus", "date": "April 6, 2021 at 1:00 pm", "content": "Watch a group of lions yawn, and it may seem like nothing more than big, lazy cats acting sleepy, but new research suggests that these yawns may be subtly communicating some important social cues. Yawning is not only contagious among lions, but it appears to help the  predators synchronize their movements , researchers report March 16 in  Animal Behaviour .\u00a0 The discovery was partially made by chance, says Elisabetta Palagi, an ethologist at the University of Pisa in Italy. While studying play behavior in spotted hyenas in South Africa, she and colleagues often had the opportunity to watch lions ( Panthera leo ) at the same time. And she quickly noticed that lions yawn quite frequently, concentrating these yawns in short time periods. Yawning is  ubiquitous among vertebrates , possibly boosting blood flow to the skull, cooling the brain and aiding alertness, especially when transitioning in and out of rest ( SN: 9/8/15 ). Fish and reptiles will yawn, but more social vertebrates such as birds and mammals appear to have co-opted the behavior for purposes conducive to group living.\u00a0In many species \u2014 like humans, monkeys, and even  parakeets  ( SN: 6/1/15 ) \u2014 yawners can infect onlookers with their \u201cyawn contagion,\u201d leading onlookers to yawn shortly afterwards. Seeing the lions yawn reminded Palagi of her own work on contagious yawning in primates. Curious if the lions\u2019 prodigious yawning was socially linked, Palagi and her team started recording videos of the big cats, analyzing when they were yawning and any behaviors around those times.\u00a0 Over four months in 2019, the researchers closely monitored 19 lions at the Greater Makalali Private Game Reserve, just west of Kruger National Park. The team found that lions that saw another member of the pride yawn were about 139 times as likely to yawn themselves within the next three minutes.\u00a0 But the yawn contagion didn\u2019t stop there. Lions that caught a yawn from another lion were 11 times as likely to mirror the movements of the original yawner than those that hadn\u2019t. This \u201cmotor synchrony\u201d involved one lion yawning, then another yawning, then the first getting up and walking around or laying back down and the other doing the same thing.\u00a0 In lions, contagious yawning might be important for maintaining social cohesion, Palagi says. Yawns that help lions harmonize their group movements could help get the pride all on the same page, crucial behavior for an animal that hunts and rears offspring cooperatively.\u00a0 \u201cIf yawn contagion has evolved to foster the creation of bonds,\u201d says Palagi, \u201cafter a yawn contagion event, the two animals need to do something together [like getting up and walking] to increase their probability of interacting.\u201d Other researchers have hypothesized that yawning could help coordinate group behavior in some species, notes Andrew Gallup, a biopsychologist at State University of New York Polytechnic Institute in Utica. \u201cBut this is the first study that I\u2019m aware of that\u2019s actually attempted to quantify that,\u201d he says. \u201cThe spreading of [yawning] across the group via contagion could serve to enhance overall collective vigilance,\u201d says Gallup. \u201cI think as time continues, we\u2019ll find that the contagious yawning is more common among some of these highly social species.\u201d Palagi notes that yawning often marks a shift between different physiological or emotional states. So, a yawn could be a good way for an individual in a social species to communicate to group mates that it is experiencing some kind of internal change.\u00a0 \u201cYawning is a widespread behavior, but I think it\u2019s one of the most mysterious,\u201d Palagi says, since it appears to have different functions from species to species.\u00a0 "},

Instead of making their own light, it turns out that remarkable little photonic crystals in  fish spots reflect certain wavelengths of light , alternating between blues and more greenish-yellows, he reports April 7 in  Royal Society Open Science . Lots of biological materials have evolved tricks manipulating light. The iconic morpho blue butterfly doesn\u2019t have a flake of blue pigment. It creates its dream-perfect sky blue with stacks of microscopic light-manipulating plates. So do  blue-leaved begonias  ( SN: 11/28/16 ). Those fish reflectors are doing something similar in wide-banded hardyhead silversides  (Atherinomorus lacunosus ). \u201cI found the flashing of a small spot by chance\u201d while screening the dots no bigger than 7 to 10 micrometers across on fish backs, he says. Inside the reflective flash spots lie little platelets of the compound guanine that have grown in such a way that they can reflect colorful light depending on the angle. Guanine may sound familiar. It\u2019s one of the four major coding units that pair up in storing DNA\u2019s genetic information. What gives the fish guanine platelets particular abilities though remains a puzzle. Iwasaka suspects that inside a spot, platelets move in ways that change their apparent color and dazzle power. The blue-yellow light pulses only in living silversides. Dead fish just reflect white-white. Iwasaka hopes to create human-made counterparts to the fish reflectors. He proposes mimicking fishy structures for sensors far, far smaller than the period on a magazine page. Versions of little sparkling fish lights could fit into the world of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) to monitor conditions inside living tissues, responding to light or flashing themselves. In earlier work, he\u2019s shown how  guanine platelets can be manipulated in magnetic fields , suggesting that such sensors could be targeted and herded. What the fish uses its lightshow for remains a mystery. Flashing spots aren\u2019t unique to wide-banded hardyhead silversides, Iwasaka points out. At least two other papers reported flashing (blue to red) in other tropical fishes, probably for communication. Maybe silverside flashing communicates something too, Iwasaka says. Or there could be safety benefits. Fish ecologist David Conover of the University of Oregon in Eugene has worked with a silvery  Menidia  species in the same fish family as the species Iwasaka studies. \u201cFor fish that live in bright light and near the surface, as do silversides, the reflectivity probably serves as a type of camouflage or distraction from predators lurking or striking from below,\u201d Conover says. Whatever drives the evolution of iridophores, those reflective spots where Iwasaka found inspiration, they\u2019re common in the fish world. There could be plenty more places to look for flashes. "},

Now researchers think they\u2019ve got the long-sought killer. jaystout/Flickr (", "date": "March 26, 2021 at 8:00 am", "content": "Mysterious deaths of bald eagles, mallards and other lake life in the southeastern United States have puzzled scientists for more than 20 years. After a long slog exploring the quirks of cyanobacteria gluing themselves to an invasive water weed, a research team has found a toxin that could be the culprit. And it\u2019s an odd one, the team reports March 26 in  Science . Nicknamed AETX, the toxin has an  unusual chemical structure  requiring building blocks rich in the element bromine, says Susan Wilde, an aquatic ecologist at the University of Georgia in Athens. Yet those bromide building blocks are not routinely abundant in southern lake water. That\u2019s where the life story of a particular water weed comes in. The mystery of the unknown toxin began at an Arkansas lake during the winter of 1994\u201395 with the nation\u2019s largest unexplained die-off of bald eagles. The eagles, coots and some other birds lost their motor coordination, struggled to fly or even walk, and had seizures. Checking the ill animals\u2019 brains revealed swathes of unnatural microscopic holes, or vacuoles. By 1998, six states had confirmed bird die-offs with the same disease, now called VM, short for vacuolar myelinopathy. Wilde noticed that lakes with die-offs grew dense expanses of the green bottlebrush-shaped invasive water plant called  Hydrilla verticillata.  In 2001, she and several generations of students and international collaborators began a long journey of exploring whether the plants and their ride-along cyanobacteria might sometimes destroy brains. \u201cIt\u2019s not a safe topic for a dissertation,\u201d she warned prospective grad students. There wasn\u2019t much money or any certainty of success. But \u201cit\u2019s so cool,\u201d she remembers them saying. One clue came from looking at this  Hydrilla  under microscope lighting that can make certain substances fluoresce. That revealed splats of cyanobacteria gripping the undersides of leaves and protecting their colonies with goo. Some other cyanobacteria, which slosh around as soup in water, release great flushes of toxins that kill fish and threaten human swimmers, but leaf-clingers weren\u2019t typically menaces. This cyanobacterium turned out to be a new species ( Aetokthonos hydrillicola ). It also turned out to be hard to grow in the lab. It took two years after collecting the stuff from a reservoir before the team raised enough cyanobacteria for their first trial feeding a watery solution of it to test animals. This cyanobacteria soup didn\u2019t seem to bother the test chickens at all, however. Microscopic analysis found no tiny holes in their brains. The researchers then wondered if something weird was going on with the lab culture setup. They collected wild weeds glopped with cyanobacteria from lakes with confirmed VM outbreaks. Using an elaborate lab setup to detect what chemical compounds the bacteria were making, the team hunted for unusual suspects. And there, lurking in the splotches marking the bacterial colonies, was a previously unknown compound, with abundant bromide molecules. These colonies did yield substances that killed test animals. And providing bromide compounds to lab colonies made them turn toxin too. Bromine can get into lakes from various sources, some natural and not, such as power plants. Researchers discovered that the invasive  Hydrilla  builds up extreme concentrations of bromine compounds, 20 times greater than the concentrations in the lake bottom mud and 500 to 1,000 times greater than in lake water. In late summer, the warm water stays at the top of the lake trapping chilly, dark, low-oxygen water below. The weedy  Hydrilla  stops flourishing and starts leaking bromine-rich compounds. That\u2019s when the cyanobacteria have the ingredients to make their deadly toxin. The newly discovered exotic chemistry of these toxin-makers doesn\u2019t surprise Jason Stajich of University of California, Riverside, who studies other cyanobacteria in his genetic explorations of microbial evolution. Free-floating cyanobacteria cause  toxic blooms  in both marine and fresh water ( SN: 8/28/18 ). But this green bacterial group also includes species that create the world we love. The  desert crusts  Stajich studies (like \u201cbread crust\u201d but on desert surfaces, he says) take years to form and depend on networks of cyanobacteria ( SN: 12/10/19 ). In this case, now that the suspect has been nabbed, there\u2019s even more reason to get rid of the  Hydrilla  invaders that facilitate the toxin making. Water birds gorge on the  Hydrilla  and its ride-along bacteria and thus get a deadly dose of toxin. Predators such as eagles and owls that feast on those water birds also get poisoned. In the lab, the toxin affects other vertebrates, such as amphibians and snakes. Knowing the makeup of the toxin will now let the lab check for effects on mammals. With such a wide range of potentially susceptible creatures, solving the mystery couldn\u2019t have come soon enough. "},

The finger-length fishes\u2019 brash, vibrant courtship displays are meant for mates and rivals, and a new study suggests that the slow waxing and waning of ice sheets and glaciers may be partly responsible for such a variety of performances.\u00a0 A new genetic analysis of more than three dozen fairy wrasse species details the roughly 12 million years of evolution that produced their vast assortment of shapes, colors and behaviors. And the timing of these transformations implies that the more than 60 species of fairy wrasses may owe their great diversity to  cyclic sea level changes over the last few millions of years , scientists report February 23 in  Systematic Biology . Within the dizzying assembly of colorful reef fishes, fairy wrasses ( Cirrhilabrus ) can\u2019t help but stand out. They are the most species-rich genus in the second most species-rich fish family in the ocean, says Yi-Kai Tea, an ichthyologist at the University of Sydney.\u00a0 \u201cThat is quite a bit of biodiversity,\u201d says Tea, who notes that new fairy wrasse species are identified every year. Despite this taxonomic footprint, Tea says, scientists knew \u201cnext to nothing\u201d about the fairy wrasses\u2019 evolutionary history or why there were so many species. To fill this knowledge gap, Tea and his colleagues turned to the fishes\u2019 genetics, extracting DNA from 39 different fairy wrasse species. Many earlier genetic studies on ocean animals in the region focused on a handful of genes in single species, but Tea and his team used a method that isolated nearly 1,000 genes from many species at once. Comparing DNA across species, the researchers reconstructed an evolutionary tree, showing how the dozens of fairy wrasse species are interrelated. The team also estimated how long ago these species split from one another.\u00a0 Fairy wrasses diverged from other wrasses about 12 million years ago in the Miocene Epoch, the researchers found. But many of the fairy wrasse species emerged only about 1 million to 3 million years ago, in the Pleistocene and late Pliocene Epochs. Fairy wrasses appear to have first evolved in the Coral Triangle, a region of exceptionally high coral reef biodiversity in the western Pacific Ocean. From there, the fishes exploded into many gaudy forms, spreading as far as the coast of East Africa to French Polynesia, a geographical range of some 17,000 kilometers.\u00a0 Tea and his colleagues think the timing of this rapid evolution is tied directly to the geologic history of the region.\u00a0 The Indo-Australian Archipelago sits at the confluence of the Indian and Pacific Ocean basins \u2014 today, a spattering of islands strung between Asia and Australia. Tea describes this boundary as a \u201csoft barrier,\u201d with the spaces between islands occasionally allowing seafaring species to pass through to the neighboring ocean realm. But during the Pliocene and Pleistocene Epochs \u2014 when many fairy wrasses diversified \u2014 ice ages dramatically changed this seascape. When water became locked up in expansions of ice sheets and glaciers, sea level fell, turning shallow reefs into land bridges. Such changes may have allowed human ancestors  to access Indonesia and Australia  ( SN: 1/9/20 ), but they also cut off the movement of marine life. This isolation encouraged the evolution of new species on either side of the barrier. When the glaciers melted again, the waters rose, and the fishes could once again intermix. The rising and falling seas could act like a \u201cspecies pump,\u201d Tea explains, creating new fairy wrasse species and churning them out into the world every time the barrier dissolved. The team estimates that fairy wrasses infiltrated the Indian Ocean at least five different times this way.\u00a0 The findings fit into an emerging picture of the region as an engine of biodiversity in tropical seas. Genetic differences between Indian and Pacific Ocean populations have been documented in everything from sea stars to giant clams, notes\u00a0Paul Barber, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Los Angeles not involved with this research. Such divergences are signs of temporary isolation on either side of the Indo-Australian Archipelago. Glacial cycles \u201cget missed sometimes in explanations of the diversification of fishes, particularly in the tropics,\u201d says Lauren Sallan, a paleobiologist at the University of Pennsylvania also not involved with this research. \u201cThat aspect just isn\u2019t brought up enough.\u201d The fairy wrasses\u2019 elaborate mating rituals might also be why there are so many different species, Tea says. Since the wrasses live in large, mixed-species schools, the males are under extra pressure to not only attract a mate, but to make sure she\u2019s of the correct species. A performance with a recognizable arrangement of colors \u2014 and in some cases,  fluorescence  ( SN: 5/29/14 ) \u2014 would come in handy. Going that extra mile to find the right species might make crossbreeding less likely, but also encourages reproductive isolation. Over time, small genetic changes accumulate in each isolated group, so that the two wrasses become fundamentally different species, dissimilar in their DNA, appearance and behavior.\u00a0 \u201cThese patterns of fluorescence and colors are very species specific,\u201d says Tea, who explains that there\u2019s \u201cheaps\u201d left to explore about fairy wrasses, especially when it comes to how they choose mates and the evolution of their colors.\u00a0 \u201cYou can dedicate your entire career to this if you wanted to and probably still never learn everything there is to learn with these amazing fishes.\u201d "},

Dennis Schroeder/NREL (", "date": "April 12, 2021 at 6:00 am", "content": "Wind energy is surging in the United States. In 2020, turbines generated about  8 percent of the country\u2019s electricity  \u2014 more than 80 times the share of wind-generated electricity in 2000 \u2014according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. While the growth is a positive step toward curbing climate change, scientists say, it could be bad news for birds. An estimated 140,000 to 500,000 birds die each year due to turbine collisions. Bird  deaths could soar to 1.4 million per year  if the U.S. Department of Energy achieves its goal of expanding wind energy to 20 percent of the country\u2019s electricity demand by 2030. To prevent avoidable deaths, some scientists are advocating for the use of citizen science and bird migration data when deciding where to construct wind farms. The wind energy industry could use such information to get a more comprehensive picture than traditional surveys provide and minimize harm to birds and  other wildlife  ( SN: 9/30/14 ). Citizen science is already proving that it can fill vital information gaps. From 2007 to 2018, more than 180,000 birders uploaded observations about bald eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) to the eBird database. Using that treasure trove of data, conservation scientist Viviana Ruiz-Gutierrez and colleagues estimated where in the United States the birds would be most abundant throughout the year \u2014  and face the highest risk of colliding with wind turbines . Unlike traditional survey data, which cover limited time periods or locations, the citizen science data span the entire United States and reflect the entire year, the team reports March 14 in the  Journal of Applied Ecology . \u201cWhat we\u2019re able to do is really harness strength that only citizen science has,\u201d says Ruiz-Gutierrez, of the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has recommended using the team\u2019s bald eagle maps to identify low-risk collision areas that are suitable for building wind turbines. Turbines can also indirectly harm animals by altering their habitats. Take whooping cranes ( Grus americana ). Each year, the only naturally occurring population of the endangered birds migrate from coastal Texas to Canada and back \u2014 a nearly 8,000-kilometer round trip \u2014 flying over a handful of U.S. states that produce most of the country\u2019s wind energy. To get a better idea of how wind energy infrastructure affects the birds, researchers analyzed GPS location data from 57 cranes tracked from 2010 through 2016. Cranes  avoided resting at sites  along the route that were near wind turbines, wildlife biologist Aaron Pearse of the U.S. Geological Survey and colleagues report March 7 in  Ecological Applications . The birds are \u201cless likely to use stopover sites if a wind structure, or group of wind structures, are within about five kilometers,\u201d says Pearse, who is based in Jamestown, N.D. As of early 2020, this equates to a net loss of 5 percent of the birds\u2019 habitat. But over the study period, the team also found that the number of turbines in the whooping cranes\u2019 migration corridor more than tripled from 2,215 to 7,622. If this trend continues, then continued habitat loss could lead to population decline, Pearse says. That\u2019s one of the reasons why whooping cranes became endangered in the first place. Like citizen science data, migration tracking data provide a clearer picture of bird activity throughout the year, Ruiz-Gutierrez says. These new types of information could help wind energy developers keep birds \u2014 and their homes \u2014 safe. "},

Rather than producing a crisp, steady beam, the laser casts a fuzzy patch of light full of randomly flickering speckles of brightness. But to a team of physicists, the laser\u2019s messy output is its greatest asset. The chaotic fluctuations in the laser\u2019s light can be translated into 254 trillion random digits per second \u2014  more than 100 times faster  than other laser-powered random number generators, researchers report in the Feb. 26  Science . \u201cThis is a marvelous step\u201d toward more efficient random number generation, says Rajarshi Roy, a physicist at the University of Maryland in College Park who was not involved in the work. Random number generators are  valuable tools in computing  ( SN: 5/27/16 ). They are used to create encryption keys that scramble private data, such as passwords and credit card numbers, so that information can travel securely over the internet. Computer simulations of complex systems, such as Earth\u2019s climate or the stock market, also require many random numbers to properly capture chance occurrences that happen in real life. Lasers can generate random number sequences thanks to tiny, naturally occurring fluctuations in the light\u2019s frequency over time. But using a laser beam to produce random numbers like that is sort of like repeatedly rolling a single die. To generate many strings of random digits from a single laser at once, physicist Hui Cao of Yale University and colleagues came up with a new design. In the team\u2019s laser, light bounces between mirrors positioned at either end of an hourglass-shaped cavity before exiting the device. This irregular shape allows light waves of various frequencies to ricochet through the laser and overlap with each other. As a result, when the laser is shined on a surface, its light contains a constantly changing pattern of tiny pinpricks that brighten and dim randomly. The brightness at each spot in the pattern over time can be translated by a computer into a random series of ones and zeros. Cao and her colleagues pointed the laser at a high-speed camera, which measured light intensity at 254 spots across the beam about every trillionth of a second. But that camera tracked the laser light for only a couple of nanoseconds before its memory filled up, after which the data were uploaded to a computer to be encoded as 0s and 1s, says Daniel Gauthier, a physicist at Ohio State University who  cowrote a commentary on the study  in the same issue of  Science . To work in the real world, this random number generator would need to be outfitted with light detectors that could send rapid-fire brightness measurements to computers in real time. "},

Steve Banner/500px/Getty Images", "date": "February 11, 2021 at 7:01 pm", "content": " an ancient site situated among the hills of western Wales, researchers suspect they have uncovered the remnants of a stone circle that contained initial building blocks of Stonehenge. Excavations of the site are in the early stages, but the stone circle was probably dismantled between 5,400 and 5,200 years ago, say University College London archaeologist Mike Parker Pearson and his colleagues. That\u2019s roughly a few hundred years or less before work began at Stonehenge. People at the newly excavated site then perhaps moved about 280 kilometers to southern England, carrying with them stones that were used in  the first phase of building the iconic monument  ( SN: 9/6/12 ), the investigators propose in the February  Antiquity . Others, though, caution that more excavation needs to be done before clinching the case. The stone circle was found at site called Waun Mawn, which lies in the Preseli region of Wales. The site is near quarries previously identified as sources of smaller Stonehenge stones, known as bluestones. If Parker Pearson\u2019s team is right, then ancient population movements out of Wales explain why bluestones at Stonehenge came from far away. Other Stonehenge stones, such as the iconic, massive boulders known as sarsen stones, came from local sources. In line with a migration scenario, large stone monuments and other signs of human activity in western Wales largely disappeared between around 5,000 to 4,000 years ago. \u201cMaybe most of the people [in the Preseli region] migrated, taking their stones \u2014 their ancestral identities \u2014 with them,\u201d Parker Pearson says.  Earlier analyses of chemical elements in cremated human remains at Stonehenge  indicated that a substantial number of those individuals had come from western Wales ( SN: 8/2/18 ). The new report raises the possibility that a 900-year-old legend about Stonehenge being built from an older, distant stone circle contains a kernel of truth. Twelfth century English cleric Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote of the mythical wizard Merlin taking an army to Ireland to capture a magical stone circle that was rebuilt as Stonehenge to commemorate the deaths of Britons killed by Saxons. Ground surveys at Waun Mawn in 2011 failed to find evidence of a stone circle. But excavations at Waun Mawn in 2017 and 2018 revealed an arc of four former standing stones and six earthen holes from which standing stones had been removed. Those finds originally formed part of a circle of perhaps 30 to 50 standing stones, the researchers estimate. Dating of sediment layers and burned wood fragments provided an age estimate for the site. Several characteristics of Waun Mawn link it to Stonehenge, the scientists contend. First, two adjacent stone holes at Waun Mawn were arranged so that their stones formed an entryway that, when viewed from the center of the circle, faced the midsummer solstice sunrise. The same alignment characterizes Stonehenge. Second, one bluestone at Stonehenge features an unusual, five-sided cross section at its base that matches the shape and dimensions of an unearthed Waun Mawn stone hole. This Stonehenge bluestone potentially came from the Wales site, the researchers suggest. Third, the complete Waun Mawn stone circle had an estimated diameter of 110 meters, the same as the ditch that encircles Stonehenge. Waun Mawn could not have supplied all of the approximately 80 bluestones at Stonehenge and at a nearby site called Bluestonehenge. Parker Pearson suspects other, still-undiscovered stone circles in western Wales contributed to the construction of Stonehenge and Bluestonehenge. There\u2019s reason to be skeptical about the new study, says archaeologist Timothy Darvill of Bournemouth University in Poole, England. \u201cWhether the discoveries at Waun Mawn are really the remains of a stone circle needs further work, including more extensive excavations to sample a wider area,\u201d he says. There are several problems with the new report, says Darvill. Known stone circles typically consist of evenly spaced stones, whereas the four stones discovered at Waun Mawn are irregularly spaced. Most large stone circles in western England and Wales have clearly defined entrances, but it\u2019s not clear that the proposed entryway at Waun Mawn served that purpose. And some earthen sockets at the Welsh site might have been created by farmers clearing fields. While the final verdict on Waun Mawn is still out, prior evidence indicates that  stones used to construct massive structures were transported and recycled in many parts of western Europe  around the time Stonehenge was assembled ( SN: 2/11/19 ), says archaeologist Chris Scarre of Durham University in England.

While the mummy\u2019s legs are caked with mud about 2.5 centimeters thick, the mud over its face is spread as thin as 1.5 millimeters. Chemical analyses of mud flakes from around the head indicate that the mud layer is covered in a white, possibly limestone-based pigment, topped with a red mineral paint. Leg fractures and other damage to the mummy\u2019s body hint that the mud wrap may have been used to restore the body after it was desecrated, potentially by tomb robbers. Repairing the body would have ensured that the deceased could continue existing in the afterlife. The mud shell may also have been a poor man\u2019s version of the expensive  resin coatings  seen on royal mummies of this era, the researchers suggest ( SN: 8/18/14 ). \u201cStatus in Egyptian society was in large part measured by proximity to the king,\u201d says Karin Sowada, an archaeologist at Macquarie University in Sydney.

While it\u2019s not known how ancient people used the shell horn, conch shells in historical and modern cultures have served as musical instruments, calling or signaling devices and sacred or magical objects, researchers say. People played the marine horn inside Marsoulas Cave, located in the French Pyrenees, say archaeologist Carole Fritz, of the University of Toulouse in France, and her colleagues. Wall paintings inside that cave depict humans, animals and geometric forms. Discoverers of the conch shell at the cave\u2019s entrance in 1931 thought it had been used as a shared drinking container. But microscopic and imaging examinations indicate that  someone cut off the shell\u2019s narrow end to create a small opening , the scientists report February 10 in  Science Advances . A cylindrical mouthpiece, possibly a hollow bird bone, was inserted in the hole, they suspect. Brownish traces of a resin or wax around the artificial opening may have come from a glue for the mouthpiece. Images of the shell\u2019s interior revealed two holes that had been chipped into spiral layers just beneath the opening, likely to hold the mouthpiece in place. By using a metal mouthpiece and blowing into the shell\u2019s artificial opening, a musicologist and horn player enlisted by the researchers produced sounds close to the musical notes C, C sharp and D. Red pigment marks shaped like human fingerprints dot the inside of the shell, near its wide opening where someone trimmed the edge. If the shell horn was used as a musical instrument, it\u2019s certainly not the oldest.  That honor goes to bone and ivory flutes  that Europeans made as early as around 40,000 years ago ( SN: 6/24/09 ). "},

L. Maher, D. Macdonald, EFAP Archive", "date": "February 16, 2021 at 8:00 am", "content": "Middle Eastern hunter-gatherers changed their relationship with the dead nearly 20,000 years ago. Clues to that spiritual shift come from the discovery of an ancient woman\u2019s fiery burial in a hut at a seasonal campsite. Burials of people in houses or other structures, as well as cremations, are thought to have originated in Neolithic-period farming villages in and around the Middle East no earlier than about 10,000 years ago. But those treatments of the dead appear to have had roots in long-standing practices of hunter-gatherers, says a team led by archaeologists Lisa Maher of the University of California, Berkeley and Danielle Macdonald of the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma. The new find suggests that people started to associate the dead with particular structures at a time when groups of hunter-gatherers were camping for part of each year at a hunting and trading site in eastern Jordan. A budding desire  to link the dead with human-built structures  possibly reflected a belief that by doing so the dead would remain close to the living, the scientists report in the March  Journal of Anthropological Archaeology . Excavations at the ancient site, now called Kharaneh IV, in 2016 revealed a woman\u2019s partial, charred skeleton on the floor of a hut that had been lit on fire. Her body had been placed on its side with knees flexed. Analyses of charring patterns on her bones and burned sediment surrounding her remains suggest the woman\u2019s body was placed inside the hut just before the brushwood structure was intentionally burned. Charcoal- and ash-rich sediment borders where the hut once stood, a sign that the fire was confined to the structure. The hut\u2019s walls apparently fell inward after being set ablaze. Radiocarbon-dated samples from the earthen floor near the woman\u2019s remains date her interment to around 19,200 years ago. Several Neolithic sites contain examples of the dead having been placed in or under burned houses, as well as instances of bodies that were intentionally burned after death, says archaeologist Peter Akkermans of Leiden University, who did not participate in the new research. \u201cThe work at Kharaneh IV now dates these practices to more than 10,000 years earlier, in wholly different cultural settings of hunter-gatherer communities versus Neolithic farming villages.\u201d Other social developments traditionally attributed to Neolithic farmers, including  year-round settlements  ( SN: 8/30/10 ) and  pottery making  ( SN: 6/28/12 ), first appeared among hunter-gatherers. Remains of at least three other huts have been found at Kharaneh IV, including one with  graves beneath the floor that contained two human skeletons  ( SN: 2/22/12 ). That roughly 19,400-year-old hut was also burned down, possibly when the site\u2019s occupants stopped using it but not as part of a human burial event. The new discovery at Kharaneh IV \u201clinks the death of a person and the destruction or death of a building as part of a funerary rite,\u201d Maher says. Perhaps the hut was where the woman or her family lived, or perhaps she died there and the structure was deemed off-limits, she suggests. Either way, Kharaneh IV was occupied for several generations after the woman\u2019s death, until roughly 18,600 years ago, so establishing a permanent place for her may have been considered important. Meanings and beliefs that Kharaneh IV residents attributed to burning a hut in which a dead woman\u2019s body had been placed are still a mystery, Maher says. The use of fire in that event might have signified some type of transformation, rebirth, cleansing or life-and-death cycle, she suggests. "},

Protesters (shown) demanded an end to gerrymandering. Evelyn Hockstein/", "date": "September 7, 2020 at 6:00 am", "content": "In October 2019, a state court determined that North Carolina\u2019s congressional districts had been severely gerrymandered and  struck down the state\u2019s map . The court\u2019s ruling was informed, in part, by tens of thousands of alternative maps demonstrating that the district boundaries had very likely been manipulated for political gain, the very definition of gerrymandering. Researchers had generated a slew of alternative, computer-generated maps designed to help identify potential patterns of bias. The approach is increasingly used, alongside other tests, to ferret out alleged gerrymandering. District manipulations can be so subtle that they\u2019re undetectable just by looking at them. \u201cThe eyeball test is no good,\u201d says Jonathan Katz, a political scientist and statistician at Caltech. U.S. states redraw their district lines every 10 years to adjust for changing demographics picked up by the national census. The last round a decade ago raised eyebrows, most notably for districts drawn in Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. \u201cThe post-2010 round of redistricting is widely viewed as a time of  extreme, even egregious, partisan gerrymandering ,\u201d retired political scientist Richard Engstrom wrote in the January 2020  Social Science Quarterly . A 2017 report by the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law noted that existing congressional maps were largely biased in favor of the Republican Party. In 26 states, which account for 85 percent of U.S. congressional districts,  as many as 17 Republicans in the House of Representatives owe their seats to gerrymandering . In states where Democrats controlled the redistricting process, partisan bias is also a problem, but the effect is smaller because those states are often made up of fewer districts. Since 2011, legal scholars, political scientists and mathematicians conducting gerrymandering research have served as expert witnesses in more than 250 state and federal court cases regarding redistricting. With the 2020 U.S. census now under way, legislators will soon be revising electoral districts again. This time around, researchers hope that instead of serving as expert witnesses in court, they can help identify problematic districting before the new maps even go into effect. \u201cIn 2010, the politicians were thinking very hard on how to draw maps,\u201d while the public and academics weren\u2019t paying a lot of attention, says Jon Eguia, an applied game theorist at Michigan State University in East Lansing. \u201cSo in 2011, [those politicians] drew a lot of very bad maps in very many states. Now we\u2019re all paying attention.\u201d According to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a state\u2019s voting districts must each contain about the same number of people and be drawn in a way that doesn\u2019t disenfranchise racial or ethnic minorities. States can have additional rules, such as contiguity of districts or that cities or counties be kept intact. That leaves two main tactics for gerrymandering: \u201cpacking\u201d the opposing political party\u2019s supporters into a few districts in hopes your party dominates the rest, or \u201ccracking\u201d these supporters by spreading them across many districts to dilute their collective voting power. Those skilled in gerrymandering draw district boundaries that ensure decade-long protection for the ruling party. \u00a0 Early methods to test a state map for gerrymandering, which are still in use today, rely on a concept known as partisan symmetry. If a map provides symmetric, or equal, opportunity for all parties in a contest to convert votes into seats, that map is deemed fair. States with packed and cracked districts won\u2019t pass tests based on symmetry. Symmetry-based tests gained prominence after  LULAC v. Perry , a 2006 Supreme Court case that reviewed a mid-decade redistricting plan in Texas. In that case, scientists entered into evidence a partisan bias test \u2014 a simulation of what would have happened in an election if the parties\u2019 vote shares were reversed. For instance, if Party A wins 10 out of 15 seats with 70 percent of the vote in an actual election, then Party B, in a hypothetical election, should win 10 seats if it had 70 percent of the vote. Deviation from that \u201csymmetry\u201d equals the level of partisan bias. In  LULAC , the justices largely upheld Texas\u2019 map. But the court indicated willingness to use a symmetry-based method in a future case, though perhaps not solely the partisan bias test. Justice Anthony Kennedy expressed concerns about that particular test, saying it was unclear how much bias was too much. Kennedy also questioned the method\u2019s reliance on statistical simulations rather than real-world results. \u201cWe are wary of adopting a constitutional standard that invalidates a map based on unfair results that would occur in a hypothetical state of affairs,\u201d he wrote in the plurality opinion for  LULAC . Kennedy\u2019s feedback on  LULAC  prompted researchers to develop other symmetry-based tests that used actual election results. One such approach is the median-mean difference test. That test arises from the basic statistical principle that the difference between the median and the mean indicates the level of skew in the data, with values closer to zero less skewed and vice versa. In 2015 in the  Election Law Journal , political scientists Michael McDonald and Robin Best of Binghamton University in New York explained how a  median-mean analysis could help identify partisan skew in a state . A party\u2019s mean vote share comes from averaging vote shares across all districts in a state. A party\u2019s median vote share comes from the district in the middle of a distribution, with the party\u2019s worst-performing district in terms of vote share at one end and the best-performing district at the other. If the difference between a party\u2019s median and mean vote shares is high, that indicates a possibly biased skew, though McDonald and Best noted that some natural skew is inevitable and must be factored into any analysis. Another approach is called the  efficiency gap , which measures the difference in packing and cracking between parties by tallying \u201cwasted\u201d votes. So, if Party A draws an electoral map that spreads Party B\u2019s voters across districts, votes cast for Candidate B in districts won by A are wasted. Conversely, if Party A packs Party B\u2019s voters into a few districts, votes cast for Candidate B beyond the majority needed to win are also wasted. Each party should have about the same number of wasted votes in an election. So the efficiency gap, first described in 2015 in the  University of Chicago Law Review , is calculated by taking the difference in wasted votes between parties and dividing that by the total number of votes cast. PlanScore, a nonpartisan group of legal, political and mapping experts, has shown  how the various symmetry tests can be used in tandem  to flag possible gerrymandering. In its analysis of the congressional map used in North Carolina\u2019s 2018 congressional elections, where Republicans won 10 seats and Democrats three, PlanScore found bias using all three tests: The partisan bias test showed that in a hypothetical, tied election, Republicans would win 26.9 percent extra seats. In the median-mean test, the median Republican vote share was 5.8 percent higher than its mean vote share. And the efficiency gap was 27.7 percent in favor of Republicans. Critics of symmetry-based tests, though, say that the presence of packing and cracking does not prove that the governing party has intentionally gerrymandered the state\u2019s districts. Instead, asymmetries can also arise from natural variations in where voters live. Crucially, Republicans tend to be more dispersed across states while Democrats are concentrated in cities. \u201cThe party that\u2019s more spread out has a geographic advantage,\u201d says applied mathematician Jonathan Mattingly of Duke University. \u201cThat\u2019s our system.\u201d Tests that have emerged over the last few years, known broadly as ensemble methods, accept that natural advantage. These tests rely on computers to generate thousands, or even millions, of possible maps. The programs draw myriad boundary lines around a given district and estimate which party would win that district under each scenario. Consider a state in which one party wins four to seven seats in almost all maps generated, while the state is using a map that regularly gives that party nine seats, Eguia says. That discrepancy suggests partisan gerrymandering. Lawyers working on gerrymandering cases tend to use ensemble and symmetry methods in tandem, says Ruth Greenwood, an attorney in Cambridge, Mass., with PlanScore and the nonpartisan nonprofit Campaign Legal Center. That\u2019s because each alternative map can also be evaluated for symmetry using the various tests. Averaging symmetry scores in the ensemble maps and comparing those values with the symmetry scores of the real-life map can illuminate when the difference is stark and therefore can\u2019t be chalked up to any \u201cnatural advantage.\u201d Using all methods together also means that when a map\u2019s fairness is questioned, the lawyers can show that \u201con any metric, the result is terrible,\u201d Greenwood says. The issue of gerrymandering was weaving through the federal courts until June 2019, when the Supreme Court ruled 5\u20134 in  Rucho v. Common Cause  that partisan gerrymandering fell outside federal jurisdiction. The decision was in response to an appeal challenging a federal court\u2019s January 2018 ruling that North Carolina\u2019s congressional district map had been gerrymandered along partisan lines, giving Republicans 10 out of 13 seats in 2016 and 2018, despite the fact that in both elections Republicans won only about half the popular vote. By removing the federal court system from gerrymandering cases, the Supreme Court left the issue to the states, a charge a North Carolina state court quickly took up in  Harper v. Lewis . The state court relied on much of the same evidence presented in  Rucho . That evidence included testimony by Mattingly showing that in a universe with 24,518 alternative congressional district maps, the map North Carolina was using was an egregious outlier. In the maps Mattingly generated, Republicans carried 10 or more seats less than 1 percent of the time. In October 2019, the three-judge panel in the  Harper  case ruled that state lawmakers needed to  redraw the congressional district map for 2020 . Plaintiffs, however, then challenged the state\u2019s remedial map, which would likely result in Republicans winning eight out of 13 seats. Mattingly  again provided expert testimony , this time adding 57,202 more maps made using less stringent constraints than the first batch. His research showed a much more purple state, with a 7\u20136 or 6\u20137 party split arising in the majority of those alternative maps. But with the state\u2019s 2020 primary fast approaching, a state court approved the remedial map in December 2019. That new map will stand for only a short time, though. Along with every other state, North Carolina will go through redistricting again in 2021 after the census tallies are in. New Jersey and Virginia \u2014 which hold statewide elections in odd years \u2014 may struggle to finish their maps before the 2021 elections, since the census was delayed due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, census watchers worry that the Trump administration\u2019s recent decision to move the completion deadline for the population count from October 31 to September 30 could lead to undercounts among hard-to-reach groups, thereby affecting the placement of district boundaries. Greenwood expects a spike in lawsuits, though now at the state rather than federal level, challenging the newly drawn maps. And a small cadre of researchers is now ready to serve as expert witnesses in those cases, Eguia says. The upcoming mapmaking process doesn\u2019t have to repeat the mistakes of a decade ago, he adds. In 2011, lawmakers drew maps largely behind closed doors without researchers present \u2014 resulting in a decade of lawsuits, he says. Why not, instead, bring researchers into the room, with their tests and myriad maps, from the get-go? \u201cThat\u2019s what the community of experts would prefer,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s what I would advocate for.\u201d "},

Engineers Eunhee Kim and Hongsoo Choi, both of the Daegu Gyeongbuk Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea, and colleagues first built rectangular robots that were 300 micrometers long. Slender horizontal grooves, about the width of nerve cells\u2019 tendrils that exchange messages with other cells, lined the top. These microrobots were fertile ground for rat nerve cells, the researchers found. As the cells grew, their message-sending axons and message-receiving dendrites neatly followed the robots\u2019 lined grooves. Once laden with about 100 nerve cells, a microrobot\u2019s objective was to nestle between two separate islands of nerve cells, grown on glass plates, and bridge the gap. Rotating magnetic fields sent the microrobot tumbling pell-mell toward its target. When the microrobot drew close, researchers used a steadier magnetic field to align the bot between the two clusters of cells. The nerve cells on the microrobot then grew out toward the clusters, while the cells in the clusters grew onto the bot. These new connections allowed neural signals to flow from one cluster of nerve cells to another, electrodes revealed. Creating these neural bridges might help researchers design better replicas of complex nerve cell networks in the brain. Similar systems could also lead to new ways of studying nerve cell growth, experiments that could ultimately point to therapies for people with  nerve injuries  ( SN: 8/11/16 ). Such precision building could also be useful in computing, allowing scientists to design and build biological computers with nerve cells. "},

The bone, just the fragment of a femur, comes from a dog that lived about 10,150 years ago, based on radiocarbon dating. That makes this  dog fossil one of the oldest , or possibly the oldest, found in the Americas, researchers report in the Feb. 24  Proceedings of the Royal Society B . Analysis of DNA from the bone, roughly the same age as three  other dogs dating to around the same time period  previously found buried in the Midwest ( SN: 4/ 16/18 ), suggests that the dog belonged to a lineage of dogs that split from Siberian dogs around 16,700 years ago. The timing of that split suggests that the dog\u2019s ancestors, probably following along with humans, had left Asia by around that time. \u201cDogs\u2019 movement and domestication is obviously very, very closely associated with humans. So the interesting thing is, if you\u2019re following dogs\u2019 movement, it can tell you something about humans as well,\u201d says Charlotte Lindqvist, an evolutionary biologist at the University at Buffalo in New York. The new finding also adds to an ongoing debate about what route humans took after arriving in North America via a land bridge in Alaska. One long-held idea is that these first colonizers  traveled inland through an ice-free corridor  ( SN: 8/8/18 ). But around 16,700 years ago, that corridor would have been covered in ice. Thus, the existence of this ancient dog supports an alternative idea \u2014 that these colonizers hugged the Pacific coast as they moved south, possibly traveling by boat. The bit of bone, smaller than a dime, was originally thought to be from a bear. But when Lindqvist and colleagues analyzed DNA from the bone, it turned out to be canine. Comparing the DNA with that from wolves, ancient dogs and modern dog breeds allowed the team to estimate when the dog last shared an ancestor with dogs from Siberia. This finding is a big deal, says Angela Perri, an archaeologist at Durham University in England, whose recent genetic research suggests that  domesticated dogs accompanied the first humans into the Americas  around 15,000 years ago. This new paper suggests that \u201cat least around 16,700 years ago, humans and dogs seemed to be moving into the Americas,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that would be almost 2,000 years earlier than we thought.\u201d Kelsey Witt, a geneticist at Brown University in Providence, R.I., looks forward to additional discoveries of early American dogs. By finding more ancient fossils and studying more DNA, Witt says, \u201cI think we\u2019ll get a better picture of exactly how people migrated and exactly when dogs came through.\u201d "},

And yet human culture blossomed there around 105,000 years ago, back when it was green, researchers say. Calcite crystals and other finds at a South African rock-shelter more than 600 kilometers from the nearest shoreline reflect  cultural behaviors on a par  with those previously reported for ancient humans living on or near South Africa\u2019s coast, researchers report March 31 in  Nature . Those coastal sites date to between roughly 125,000 and 70,000 years ago, including one where  locals used tools to make paint out of pigment around 100,000 years ago  ( SN: 10/13/11 ). Given the scarcity of human sites from that time period, it\u2019s hard to know whether cultural innovations emerged independently in groups spread across southern Africa or originated in one particular region before being adopted elsewhere. But the new discoveries fit a scenario in which \u201cthe emergence of  Homo sapiens  involved the interaction of many different populations across Africa,\u201d says archaeologist Jayne Wilkins of Griffith University in Nathan, Australia. \u201cAnd that included the Kalahari Desert.\u201d Excavations at Ga-Mohana Hill North Rockshelter, or GHN, uncovered an ancient sediment layer containing 42 burned ostrich eggshell fragments and 22 palm-sized or smaller calcite crystals, Wilkins and her colleagues report. Like some African hunter-gatherer groups today, ancient people at GHN may have cut holes out of ostrich eggshells to create water containers, the researchers say. Geologic studies indicated that enough rain once fell over the southern Kalahari Desert to have produced year-round water sources for ancient GHN people. Many eggshell pieces showed discoloration from burning. It\u2019s not clear how that burning occurred. Eggshells lay among numerous animal bones, some of which displayed possible butchery marks and signs of burning. The calcite crystals were probably collected from local rock sources, one of which lies about 2.5 kilometers from the rock-shelter, the scientists suspect. Excavated calcite crystals hadn\u2019t been modified in any way and had no apparent practical use, raising the possibility that these items held ritual or symbolic significance, Wilkins suspects. Crystals have been linked to spiritual beliefs and rituals in many parts of the world. Until now, the oldest set of crystals dated to around 80,000 years ago at another South African rock-shelter located about 130 kilometers from the coast, Wilkins says. Other GHN finds included hundreds of stone tools, prepared rock chunks from which tools were struck and a piece of red pigment bearing scrape marks. Ancient  cultural evolution  in many parts of Africa remains a mystery, writes archaeologist Pamela Willoughby of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, in a commentary published with the new study. Calcite crystals found at GHN perhaps represent \u201can early example of ritualistic symbolic behavior,\u201d according to Willoughby. Any ritualistic use of the GHN crystals is difficult to demonstrate, contends archaeologist Manuel Will of the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany. Ostrich eggshell pieces found at the Kalahari site could have been discarded after a meal, he says. Still, the new study adds to growing skepticism about  claims that human cultural advances started along African coasts , Will says ( SN: 7/29/11 ).

Researchers have typically  assumed that men ran Bronze Age societies  ( SN: 10/10/19 ). In 2014, a team led by archaeologist Vicente Lull of the Autonomous University of Barcelona discovered the skeletons of a man and a woman in a large jar underneath what appears to be a royal structure at a site called La Almoloya. Radiocarbon dating indicates that both individuals died about 3,700 years ago. Most of the  29 valuables in the grave  lay on or next to the woman, Lull\u2019s group reports in the April  Antiquity . A semicircular silver headband, or diadem, with a disk that would have rested on the forehead or the bridge of the nose, was found on the woman\u2019s skull. Excavations at other El Argar sites in the 19th and 20th centuries yielded several females buried with diadems. Functions of the buildings under which those graves were located are unknown. But diadems signified power and social prominence, the researchers contend. At La Almoloya, the woman and man were buried beneath a room where up to around 50 people could have conducted royal and political business. Other parts of what was likely a palace contained living quarters and spaces for activities such as grinding grain. If the La Almoloya woman was a queen, the researchers can\u2019t say if she was a ceremonial leader or made actual rulings, either on her own or with a royal council. "},

Norton & Co., $26.95 It\u2019s a familiar trope in movies and books: A bright-eyed protagonist moves to the big city in search of fame and fortune. Amid the bustle and lights, all hopes and dreams come true. But why do we cling to this clich\u00e9? In  Four Lost Cities: A Secret History of the Urban Age , author Annalee Newitz explores ancient settlements to find out why people flock to big cities \u2014 and why they leave. \u00a0 The book is divided into four enjoyable, snack-sized sections, one for each city. Each section is accompanied by a handy map, drawn by artist Jason Thompson with engaging, cartoon-style flair. Rather than dry history, Newitz makes a special effort to highlight the oddities and innovations that made these cities unique. Take \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, the oldest city they feature, which thrived from 7500 to 5700 B.C. in what is now Turkey. This ancient city persisted for nearly 2,000 years despite lacking things that we might consider necessary to a city, such as roads, dedicated public spaces or shopping areas. Newitz\u2019s also explores Pompeii (700 B.C to A.D. 79 in modern-day Italy). When paired with \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, it offers insights into how humans developed the distinction between public and private spaces and activities \u2014 ideas that would not have made sense before humans began living in large settled groups. The section on Cahokia (A.D. 1050 to 1350) \u2014 located in what is now Illinois, across the Mississippi River from St. Louis \u2014 offers an unexpected reason for a city\u2019s emergence. Many people link cities with capitalism and trade. Cahokia\u2019s 30-meter-tall pyramids, 20-hectare plazas and a population (at the time) bigger than Paris suggest that spiritual revival can also build a major metropolis. Cahokia and Angkor, which reached its peak from A.D. 800 to 1431 in what is now Cambodia, also show how cities can form when power gets concentrated in a few influential people.\u00a0 Through touring such diverse cities, Newitz shows that the move to urban life isn\u2019t just a setup for a hero of a story. It\u2019s a common setup for many ancient cultures. Each city, of course, eventually fell. \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck and Angkor suffered from  droughts and flooding  ( SN: 10/17/18 ). Pompeii felt the fury of  a volcano  ( SN: 1/23/20 ). But Newitz also reveals something else: Collapsing infrastructure provided the final push that kept people away. Here we glimpse our potential future, as climate crises and political instability threaten our own urban networks. But Newitz\u2019s vivid imaginings, bright prose and boundless enthusiasm manage to keep the tone optimistic. These cities did end, yes. Yet the people who built them and resided in them lived on. Even in Pompeii, many inhabitants made it out. Collectively, they went to new places and spurred new growth. Four Lost Cities  is about how cities collapse. But it\u2019s also about what makes a city succeed. It\u2019s not glamour or Wall Street. It\u2019s not good restaurants or big factories. It\u2019s people and their infrastructure. It\u2019s clean water, public spaces, decent roads and opportunities for residents to live with dignity and improve their lot, Newitz explains. And when infrastructure crumbles beyond repair, people inevitably move on. \u201cOur forebears\u2019 eroded palaces and villas warn us about how communities can go wrong,\u201d they write. \u201cBut their streets and plazas testify to all the times we built something meaningful together.\u201d Buy  Four Lost Cities  from Bookshop.org.

Until now, investigations have shown only that  humans can work jointly toward a common goal  presumed to require back-and-forth exchanges and an appreciation of being obligated to a partner ( SN: 10/5/09 ). Primate biologist Raphaela Heesen of Durham University in England and colleagues studied 15 of the endangered great apes at a French zoological park. The researchers interrupted 85 instances of social grooming, in which one ape cleaned another\u2019s fur, and 26 instances of self-grooming or solitary play. Interruptions consisted either of a keeper calling one bonobo in a grooming pair to come over for a food reward or a keeper rapidly opening and closing a sliding door to an indoor enclosure, which typically signaled mealtime and thus attracted both bonobos. Social grooming resumed, on average, 80 percent of the time  after food rewards and 83 percent of the time after sliding-door disruptions, the researchers report December 18 in  Science Advances . In contrast, self-grooming or playing alone was resumed only around 50 percent of the time, on average. Bonobos generally resumed social grooming with the same partner within one minute of an interruption, usually near the original grooming spot. Groomers frequently took up where they had left off on a partner\u2019s body. And bonobos more often vocalized, gestured or otherwise communicated when restarting social grooming if they had been the one responsible for initiating the session or interrupting it for a food reward. That was especially true of higher-ranking bonobos in the community, suggesting some awareness of having broken a joint commitment and wanting to signal friendly intent when rejoining lower-ranking grooming partners, the scientists say. Still, it\u2019s likely that bonobos think in less complex ways than people do about mutual commitments, Heesen and colleagues say. In previous studies, even 3-year-old children were much less willing to interrupt joint tasks for rewards than bonobos were in the new experiments. "},

Even before the emergence of the novel coronavirus, U.S. college students struggled with depression, anxiety and other mental health disorders at higher rates than the general population. Many college students are grappling with a new social environment, struggling to figure out their careers and worrying about finances, says Matthew Browning, an environmental psychologist at Clemson University in South Carolina. To assess how the pandemic is impacting student mental health, Browning and colleagues surveyed more than 2,500 students from seven public universities across the United States last spring when the pandemic was ramping up. Study participants ranked statements about their emotional state, preoccupation with COVID-19, stress and time use. Based on total scores, researchers classified the students as having experienced high, moderate or low levels of emotional distress and worry. The researchers note that they did not use standardized screening tools for disorders such as anxiety and depression, but instead zoomed in on  mental health stressors arising directly from the pandemic  ( SN: 3/29/20 ). About 85 percent of the students surveyed experienced high to moderate levels of distress, Browning\u2019s team found \u2014 about 45 percent were highly impacted and about 40 percent were moderately impacted. Those who reported low levels of distress were more likely to be white and spend two or more hours outdoors. \u00a0 Certain factors put some students at greater risk of feeling highly distressed.

Accepting the idea that feeling bored is normal could help people cope, researchers say. Jarernchai Torchot/EyeEm/Getty Images Plus", "date": "February 15, 2021 at 6:00 am", "content": "In recent months, journalists and public health experts have bandied about the term \u201cpandemic fatigue.\u201d Though not clearly defined, the general gist is that people have grown tired of the pandemic and keeping apart for almost a year and running.  That fatigue  can manifest as feelings of anxiety, hopelessness, frustration, anger and boredom. Seeing boredom on that list worries those who study the phenomenon. \u201cUsually boredom tells you that you should do something else,\u201d says sports psychologist Wanja Wolff of the University of Konstanz in Germany. \u201cIn the context of a pandemic \u2026 that might not be the best thing.\u201d Recently, those fears have received more traction. Two similar yet independent studies, one by Wolff and colleagues and another by a U.S.-Canadian research team, found that people who frequently feel bored are more likely than others to flout social distancing guidelines. Those boredom-prone individuals also appear to be at higher risk of contracting the coronavirus. Boredom, these studies suggest, may well constitute a real, yet underappreciated, public health threat. Across the Western humanities, boredom has typically been depicted as an individual failing. The 19th century German pessimist Arthur Schopenhauer defined boredom as the sensation of the emptiness of existence. French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called it a \u201cleprosy of the soul.\u201d But researchers studying boredom say it merits a more neutral reading. That feeling of having nothing to do \u2014 what Russian author Leo Tolstoy called \u201cthe desire for desires\u201d \u2014 serves as a signal, a call to the body to shift gears, goes the current thinking. \u201cBoredom is a sign that you\u2019re not meaningfully engaged in the world,\u201d says social psychologist Erin Westgate of the University of Florida in Gainesville. Researchers, including Westgate, have identified two paths to boredom: a loss of focus or a loss of meaning. Certainly, many of us have lost the focus, or mental acuity, of the Before Times, Westgate says. In addition to a deadly pandemic that has brought city shutdowns and remote schooling, there have been civil rights protests, political unrest, a crippling recession and myriad other stressors both big and small. Those disturbances, which hobble our ability to stay mentally sharp, can lead to dullness. When boredom is defined this way, the busyness of, say, parents of young children provides little protection against feeling blah. In fact, Westgate and others have found that both understimulation and overstimulation can  short-circuit one\u2019s ability to pay attention . Meanwhile, many of our lives have come unraveled. Research by personality and social psychologist Samantha Heintzelman of Rutgers University-Newark in New Jersey shows that simple routines, like getting coffee from the same caf\u00e9 every day or a standing lunch date with a friend, actually  imbue life with meaning . \u201cWe\u2019re in a collective loss of routine right now,\u201d Heintzelman says. That is to say, the social distancing guidelines aimed at protecting us from a deadly disease have also stolen the seemingly  little things that give life meaning  ( SN: 8/14/20 ). When people lose both focus and meaning in their lives, this form of boredom is \u201cdoubly bad,\u201d Westgate says. \u201cYou can be bored because something is meaningful, but you can\u2019t pay attention because it\u2019s too easy or too hard. You can also be bored because you can pay attention, but it\u2019s meaningless,\u201d she says. \u201cBut if something is meaningless and you can\u2019t pay attention, you\u2019re like double bored.\u201d Those two new boredom studies \u2014 each including almost 1,000 North American participants \u2014 show how elevated boredom levels among those prone to the feeling may be playing out during this pandemic. In the study by the U.S.-Canadian team, researchers sought to quantify the link between a person\u2019s innate propensity for boredom and rule-breaking behaviors during the pandemic, such as spending fewer hours apart from others or holding a social gathering.  Boredom proneness across the sample explained 25 percent of the variance in rule-breaking behaviors , the team reports in the March  Personality and Individual Differences . The researchers did not find a strong relationship between rule-breaking and other factors that might influence it, such as age or gender. (Young adults and men tend to score higher on boredom than other groups.) No single factor can explain 100 percent of any human behavior, says study coauthor and cognitive neuroscientist James Danckert of the University of Waterloo in Canada. But \u201c25 percent is a huge amount.\u201d Wolff and colleagues, whose findings appeared online July 28 in the  International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health , meanwhile found that  boredom-prone people ranked social distancing as more difficult  than others did, and were less likely to adhere to social distancing guidelines. Both teams showed that those who scored higher in boredom were also slightly more likely than those scoring lower to report having gotten COVID-19. \u201cBoredom is an incredibly powerful motivator for behavior,\u201d Wolff says. Yet, he adds, people can struggle with how to respond to that signal in safe and meaningful ways. Westgate is not surprised that people who are especially prone to boredom, yet able to socially distance, find staying home mind-numbingly dull. She does wonder, though, about the rest of us: How are people who aren\u2019t used to being bored contending with the loss of focus and meaning brought on by the pandemic? Are they also breaking the rules? The research here is less direct but suggestive. In a 2014 study in  Science , Westgate and colleagues asked 42 undergraduate students to sit alone with their thoughts for several minutes, no cell phones allowed. The students, though, had the option to push a button to receive a painful electric shock. About  two-thirds of the male and a quarter of the female students  pushed that button, some repeatedly, suggesting that  even pain can be preferable to boredom  for some ( SN:  7/3/14 ). Similarly, a 2019 study in  Behavioral Decision Making  by social psychologist Wijnand Van Tilburg and colleagues showed that inducing boredom in people through a repetitive gambling game prompted them to  make riskier decisions . Momentary boredom is not inherently bad, says Van Tilburg, of the University of Essex in England. But over a longer period, boredom can lead to serious public health outcomes if the situation \u201cis unresolved or the resolution to it is harmful, like overeating or becoming aggressive or not wearing a mask,\u201d he says. \u00a0 A recent study provides clues to how unresolved boredom may be playing out. Most epidemiological models assume that people will start and maintain social distancing as soon as COVID-19 cases begin going up in an area. That would cause deaths, which lag cases by a few weeks, to spike but then plummet in response to the social distancing \u2014 causing the model forecasts of deaths to resemble a mountain with a sharp peak. But researchers reporting in the Dec. 22  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  found, based on  Google\u2019s COVID-19 Mobility Reports ,that in most U.S. states, people did initially hunker down as cases rose in the spring and summer, but then increased their movements before the threat had passed. As a result, true curves of COVID-19 fatalities  resemble not a peak but plateaus or short dips followed by a rapid increase . That is, death rates did not plummet as expected but remained high. When the researchers incorporated that premature resurgence of activity into epidemiological models, the predicted curves better replicated real-life fatality patterns. The authors attribute people\u2019s actions, and the higher-than-expected death toll, to pandemic fatigue, which includes boredom. In the coming months, boredom from pandemic fatigue may well intensify. The spread of the coronavirus, including  new and even more contagious variants  ( SN: 1/15/21 ), in the United States and many other places continues to spiral out of control. Though hope is at hand with the rollout of vaccines, public health experts warn that vaccinating enough people to halt the virus\u2019 spread in the United States could take us well into 2021. What is that collision of hope and despair doing to our levels of boredom? How many of us will drop our guard? Wolff is now investigating how to help those experiencing boredom follow social distancing rules. His July paper showed that when boredom-prone people exhibit high self-control, they do a better job with adherence. Training people to have more self-control may be difficult though, Wolff says. Instead, he suggests that people reduce the need for self-control by creating contingency plans. His preliminary research, posted online June 25 at PsyArXiv.com, suggests that such \u201cif-then\u201d plans can help. For instance, if an indoor gym is too dangerous, a person could instead plan to start running outside. Wolff suggests people take small steps to make it easier to follow such a change in routine, such as putting workout clothes out on the bed the night before and sneakers by the front door. \u201cThe idea is to make behavior more automatic,\u201d he says. But even with the best-laid plans, retaining focus and meaning during the pandemic is no easy task. Researchers say it\u2019s worth reminding ourselves that boredom is a neutral signal, neither bad nor good. And some people who hunker down right now and explore that feeling may discover that the boredom has deeper roots that may even predate the pandemic. So perhaps the most optimistic framing of the situation is that some people will use this protracted moment of boredom to think about larger life goals, Van Tilburg says. \u201cIt is possible to get meaning out of these negative situations.\u201d \u00a0 "},

Noelle Moen", "date": "February 16, 2021 at 12:57 pm", "content": "It was a cold, overcast Saturday morning in Salem, Ore., when Jesse Laney set out to catch a glimpse of a painted bunting. He\u2019d heard earlier that week through a birding WhatsApp group that this vibrant, rainbow-colored bird was in the area. Painted buntings ( Passerina ciris ) are common in places like Texas and the northern parts of Mexico, but a rarity in Oregon. Laney and his sons raced to the site and began searching \u2014 but the bird eluded them. He wasn\u2019t too disappointed, though. Just the chance of seeing a rare bird \u201cscratches the ever-present itch of participating in a small bit of discovery,\u201d says Laney, an ecologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis. \u00a0 That itch has now inspired research debunking a popular myth among birders: That a rare bird sighting leads to more sightings of other rare bird species because birders flock to an area to find the initial bird. This phenomenon is called the Patagonia Picnic Table Effect. Its origin story dates back to sometime in the 1960s or \u201870s. Though details are a bit unclear, birders saw a rare black-capped gnatcatcher, or a pair of rose-throated becards, in Patagonia, a town near the Arizona-Mexico border. Word got around and birders descended on the town, which led to sightings of other rare birds, including a five-striped sparrow and a yellow grosbeak, according to some accounts. To determine if such discovery bonanzas are one-off events or a common occurrence, Laney and his colleagues analyzed data from 2008 to 2017 from the online database eBird. Avid birders typically upload their checklists \u2014 that is, birds they have spotted on an outing \u2014 to the site. The team identified 273 so-called mega-rarities mostly in the continental United States; these are the hardest-to-find birds, either because there are so few of them or because they rarely show up in some geographical locations. The researchers then evaluated rare bird discovery rates before and after crowds raced to where those ultra-uncommon birds were spotted. The rates remained essentially the same, the team reports January 21 in  PeerJ,  at  8 detections per 1,000 checklists . Birders had no better chance of finding a second species of rare bird in an area where there was a recent rare bird sighting than they did during routine birding. This belief that one success can lead to more isn\u2019t limited to the birding community. When an athlete magically makes one shot after another, that streak is referred to as  the hot hand effect  ( SN: 1/12/12 ). We want to believe such patterns exist, says Andreas Wilke, a psychologist at Clarkson University in Potsdam, N.Y. That thinking once gave humans an evolutionary advantage when it came to such survival skills as finding food, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a very adaptive thing to do but it can misfire in modern environments when we look at very random distributions of things and start to see patterns that don\u2019t exist.\u201d "},

Popularizing brown bandages could help unravel that legacy of medical racism, medical experts argue.

The school nurse cleaned her up and covered the wound with a peach-tinted bandage. On Oyesiku\u2019s dark skin, the bandage stuck out, so Oyesiku colored it with a brown marker. Years later, Oyesiku, now a medical student at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, needed to conceal a wound on her face after undergoing surgery. Well aware that the surgeon\u2019s office was unlikely to have a supply of brown bandages on hand, she came prepared with her own box. Those episodes left her wondering, though: Why were such bandages not more widely available? The ubiquity of peach or \u201cflesh\u201d colored bandages provides a stark reminder that medicine remains centered on white patients, says Oyesiku, who calls for  brown bandages to become mainstream .  Brown bandages would symbolize that patients of color no longer represent \u201cdeviations from the norm,\u201d she writes in an October commentary in  Pediatric Dermatology . Peach-tinted bandages, invented by pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson in the 1920s, have been the standard-bearer for a century. Normalizing peach as the default flesh color has had knock-on effects: The nicotine and birth control adhesive patches that have since appeared on the market are also tinted peach, Oyesiku reports. Over the last several decades, smaller companies have introduced bandages for multiple skin tones, but those remain harder to come by than peach-tinted ones. The issue goes deeper than a bandage, Oyesiku says. Treating whiteness as the default in medicine contributes to  Black and other minority groups\u2019 distrust of medical professionals  ( SN:  4/10/20 ) and has led to  biases in machine learning programs  that U.S. hospitals use to prioritize patient care ( SN:  10/24/19 ). The field of dermatology represents an obvious starting point for dismantling structural racism in medicine, says dermatologist Jules Lipoff of the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cDermatology is racist only inasmuch as all of medicine and all of society is. But because we are at the surface, that racism is easier to recognize.\u201d \u00a0 Consider \u201cCOVID toes.\u201d This condition, a symptom of COVID-19 infection, is characterized by swollen and discolored toes and occasionally fingers. When researchers reviewed 130 images of skin conditions associated with COVID-19, though, they found that  almost all the images depicted people with white skin.  Because COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted Black communities in the United States and the United Kingdom, photos depicting this population are crucial to proper diagnosis and care, researchers report in the September 2020  British Journal of Dermatology . This scarcity of medical images for dark skin is pervasive. Only  4.5 percent of images in common medical textbooks depict dark skin , Lipoff and colleagues reported in the Jan. 1  Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. At least when it comes to bandages, change might be afoot. Last June, in response to civil rights protests,  Johnson & Johnson pledged to roll out bandages for multiple skin tones . Whether health care providers and stores routinely stock such bandages remains to be seen.

The specimen marks a technological turn to manipulating objects with wide, flat stone surfaces, say Ron Shimelmitz, an archaeologist at the University of Haifa in Israel, and his colleagues. Up to that time, stone implements had featured thin points or sharp edges. Microscopic wear and polish on a worn section of the Tabun stone resulted from it having been  ground or rubbed against relatively soft material , such as animal hides or plants, the scientists conclude in the January  Journal of Human Evolution . Similar stones bearing signs of abrasion date to no more than around 200,000 years ago. Specific ways in which the Tabun stone was used remain a mystery. By around 50,000 years ago, though, human groups were using grinding stones to prepare plants and other foods, Shimelmitz says. The team compared microscopic damage on the Tabun stone to that produced in experiments with nine similar stones collected near the cave site. Archaeology students forcefully ran each of the nine stones back-and-forth for 20 minutes over different surfaces: hard basalt rock, wood of medium hardness or a soft deer hide. Those applied to deer hide displayed much in common with the business end of the ancient stone tool, including a wavy surface and clusters of shallow grooves.

With so many parents now juggling work and childcare, researchers worry burnout levels must be even higher. Parents in non-Western countries, though, might be faring better, a new study suggests. doble-d/iStock/Getty Images Plus", "date": "March 29, 2021 at 6:00 am", "content": "The ongoing pandemic has hammered parents. For many, work shifted to home. Schools closed or went partially remote in many places. Grandparents at high risk of getting severely ill with COVID-19 isolated. That left many parents operating with minimal social support. Now, a new study of 17,409 parents from 42 countries measuring parental burnout shows that this exhaustion was high even in the Before Times \u2014 particularly in Western countries. The culprit? A country\u2019s level of individualism, or emphasis on independence. Parenting in individualist countries is often an intensely solitary pursuit. Parents living in countries with a culture of collectivism, meanwhile, can rely on extended family and friends, even acquaintances, to share in child rearing.\u00a0 \u201cI had the intuition that individualism would contribute to parental burnout,\u201d says psychologist Isabelle Roskam of the University of Louvain in Belgium. But Roskam, whose findings appear in the March 18  Affective Science,  was surprised to find that no other social factor she measured, such as a parent\u2019s workload or time spent with children,  was linked to parental burnout . Parental burnout can take an enormous toll on families, Roskam says. Parents may withdraw or lash out and children suffer the consequences. Surveyed parents answered demographic questions, such as the number and ages of children in the household, hours a day spent with children, number of adult women or men caregivers in the house and working status. They also completed an established 23-question parental burnout assessment, where they described the frequency of feelings, such as: \u201cI feel completely run down by my role as a parent\u201d and \u201cI do not enjoy being with my children.\u201d The scale ranged from zero for never to six for daily. Parents were identified as burned-out if their total survey score, computed by simply adding up the responses, was\u00a0equal to or greater than 92. Team members evaluated those scores alongside a country\u2019s individualism score, computed by the data analytics company Hofstede Insights. Higher individualism scores linked to higher levels of burned-out parents, the team found. For instance, in the United States, which has an individualism score of 91, about 8 percent of parents were burned-out. Conversely, in countries with individualism scores at or below 20, including Pakistan, Ecuador and China, fewer than 2 percent of parents were burned-out. \u00a0\u00a0 This study is the first to compare burnout across Western and non-Western countries. But sociologist Frank Furedi worries that using terms like \u201crun down\u201d and \u201cenjoyment\u201d in reference to parenting may not make sense to people in non-Western countries, rendering responses from parents in those countries meaningless. More neutral questions, such as asking parents the optimum amount of time they would like to spend with their children, would have provided a better comparison, says Furedi of the University of Kent in Canterbury, England. \u201cThis study projects a [Western] imagination onto the rest of the world.\u201d \u00a0 Researchers can now drill down to see what is going on within countries, counters anthropologist and sociologist Charlotte Faircloth of University College London. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice framework for some more granular work.\u201d Roskam is currently doing that granular work closer to home. Her new data show that parental burnout in Belgium stayed flat from 2019 to after the first pandemic shutdown in 2020. But like most averages, that analysis obscures people\u2019s lived experiences: Some parents suffered tremendously in early 2020 while others thrived. What factors, she wonders, protected those parents who fared well? And how are those parents doing now? Not well, Roskam hypothesizes, speaking from first-hand experience. The mother of five children, preschool to university age, Roskam initially came up with creative solutions to keeping her children engaged. \u201cBut now,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019m completely exhausted.\u201d "},

One side has three support pieces, the other two. How would you stabilize the bridge? Most people would add a piece so that there are three supports on each side, a new study suggests.

It turns out that getting people to subtract \u2014 whether a Lego block, ingredients in a recipe or words in an essay \u2014  requires reminders and rewards , researchers report April 7 in  Nature . This default to addition isn\u2019t limited to assembling blocks, cooking and writing. Rather, thinking in pluses instead of minuses could well contribute to modern-day excesses such as cluttered homes, institutional red tape and even an overburdened planet, says behavioral scientist Benjamin Converse of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. \u201cWe\u2019re missing an entire class of solutions.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 He and his colleagues first observed the behavior when they asked 1,585 study participants to tackle eight puzzles and problems that could be solved by adding or removing some things. For example, one puzzle required shading or erasing squares on a grid to make a pattern symmetric. In another, individuals could add or subtract items on a travel itinerary for the optimal experience. Across all experiments, the vast majority of participants chose addition over subtraction. For instance, out of 94 participants who completed the grid task, 73 added squares, 18 subtracted squares and another three simply reworked the original number of squares. The researchers hypothesized that most participants defaulted to adding because they failed to even think about subtraction. So, through a series of controlled experiments, the team nudged participants toward the minus sign. In one experiment, the team offered 197 people wandering around a crowded university quad a dollar to solve a puzzle. Participants viewed a Lego structure in which a figurine was standing atop a platform with a large pillar behind her. Atop that pillar, a single block in one corner supported a flat roof. Researchers asked the participants to stabilize the roof to avoid squashing the figurine. About half the participants were told: \u201cEach piece you add costs 10 cents.\u201d Even with that financial penalty, only 40 out of 98 participants thought to remove the destabilizing block and just rest the roof on top of the wide pillar. The researchers gave the remaining participants a more explicit message: \u201cEach piece you add costs 10 cents but removing pieces is free.\u201d That cue prompted 60 out of 99 participants to remove the block. Practice did help participants call to mind that elusive minus sign, the researchers found. A variation on the grid experiment, where subtraction yielded the superior solution, showed that three practice runs leading up to the actual task prompted more participants to subtract than those who solved the task without practice. \u00a0 \u201cWhen people try to make something better \u2026 they don\u2019t think that they can remove or subtract unless they are somehow prompted to do so,\u201d says behavioral scientist Gabrielle Adams, also at the University of Virginia. \u00a0 Conversely, bombarding participants  with unrelated information  decreased their likelihood of subtracting ( SN: 5/24/20 ). People add even more when they experience information overload, those experiments showed. On an intuitive level, people recognize that subtraction comes less naturally than addition, the authors say. Hence the adoption of adages, such as \u201cless is more\u201d and Marie Kondo\u2019s now infamous mantra to get rid of those things that fail to spark joy. But curbing our love of excess will take more than nudges and a clear mind, says Hal Arkes, a judgement and decision-making researcher at Ohio State University who was not involved with the study. Organizational and political leaders, especially, abhor cutting the fat. \u201cIf you add more people and more dollars, you won\u2019t make any enemies, you\u2019ll just make friends,\u201d Arkes says. \u201cSubtraction has serious downsides.\u201d "},

Latex gloves and polypropylene masks which protect people from the coronavirus are exacerbating the  plastic pollution problem  when not disposed of properly and are causing wildlife deaths ( SN:11/20/20 ). The study is the first global documentation of the impacts of COVID-19 litter on wildlife via entanglement, entrapment and  ingestion  ( SN:12/15/20 ). In August 2020, volunteers cleaning canals in Leiden, Netherlands, chanced upon a perch \u2014 a type of freshwater fish \u2014 trapped inside a finger of a latex glove. The ensnared fish was the first recorded wildlife casualty caused by COVID-19 litter in the Netherlands. The find shocked two Leiden-based biologists \u2014 Auke-Florian Hiemstra and Liselotte Rambonnet \u2014 who wanted to know more about the extent of COVID-19 litter\u2019s impact on wildlife. They embarked on an extensive search, online and in newspapers, to collate examples. They found 28 such instances from all around the world, pointing to a larger, global problem.\u00a0\u00a0 The earliest reported victim was from April 2020: an American robin in Canada, which appears to have died after getting entangled in a face mask. Pets are at risk, too: In Philadelphia, a domestic cat ingested a glove, and a pet dog in Boston that had consumed a face mask. \u201cAnimals with plastic in their stomach could starve to death,\u201d says Rambonnet, of Leiden University. \u201cWhat this paper does is give us insight to the extent of the [COVID-19] litter\u2019s impact on wildlife, so we can make efforts to minimize the consequences,\u201d says Anna Schwarz, a sustainable plastics researcher at TNO, an independent organization for applied scientific research in Utrecht, Netherlands. That could be a tall order: A report published by Hong Kong\u2013based marine conservation organization OceansAsia, for instance,  estimates that  1.56 billion face masks would have entered the world\u2019s ocean last year , part of the 8 million to 12 million metric tons of plastic that reaches the oceans annually. As the far-reaching impacts of COVID-19 litter on wildlife become more apparent over time, Hiemstra, of the Naturalis Biodiversity Center, and Rambonnet are relying on citizen scientists to help them continue monitoring the situation: At  www.covidlitter.com , people from around the world can submit their observations of affected wildlife. To curb the growing hazards, the study authors recommend switching to reusables wherever possible, as well as cutting up disposal gloves and snipping the straps off of single-use masks to prevent animals from getting entangled or trapped in them. \u201cThe paper highlights the importance of proper waste management, especially the recycling or disposal of single-use materials,\u201d says Schwarz. But the situation isn\u2019t always so dire. Some animals have commandeered discarded PPE for their own uses. COVID-19 litter has become so pervasive that birds have been observed using face masks and gloves as building materials for their nests. \u201cBird nests from 2020 are so easy to recognize,\u201d says Hiemstra.

But researchers have recently found one mantis species that takes this otherworldly quality to the next level: Females of this species have an inflatable pheromone gland that protrudes from the back of the abdomen like a green, Y-shaped balloon.\u00a0 This odd organ is unlike anything seen in mantises before, researchers  report  online April 21 in the  Journal of Orthoptera Research . In October 2017, herpetologist Frank Glaw was moving through the nighttime rainforest in Amazonian Peru at the Panguana research station, searching for amphibians and reptiles. His flashlight passed over a brown, leaf-mimicking mantis ( Stenophylla lobivertex ) in the tangle of vegetation, and he saw \u201cmaggotlike\u201d structures protruding from its back. Those structures were quickly sucked back inside the insect after the light hit it, says Glaw, of the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology in Munich, Germany. Glaw was reminded of \u201cparasites that eat the animal from the inside,\u201d having seen such fatally parasitized insects before. With the help of Christian Schwarz, an entomologist at Ruhr-University Bochum in Germany, and observations of some female specimens in captivity, the team figured out that the mantis was no parasite-riddled vessel.\u00a0 When left undisturbed in total darkness, the female mantises extrude a pronged structure inflated with body fluids, roughly the hue and luster of polished jade. It appears to be a highly modified gland for producing pheromones \u2014 chemical signals that  help female insects attract mates  ( SN: 5/13/15 ).\u00a0 Other mantises have simple, noninflatable glands that are located in the same section of abdomen as  S. lobivertex \u2019s bifurcated contraption. This mantis species is rarely encountered by researchers and might be thinly spread throughout the rainforest, so locating receptive mates could be particularly challenging. The researchers think a large, protrusible pheromone gland with lots of surface area could be a workaround, more efficiently dispersing pheromones to be detected by the antennae of would-be suitors. \u201cIt is a kind of chemical \u2018dating app\u2019 in the jungle,\u201d says Glaw, noting that the observations \u201cemphasize the importance of pheromones in [the mantises\u2019] reproduction in a vivid manner.\u201d Females in some other mantis species are known to expose a pink, patchlike gland when doing their chemical call for mates, says Henrique Rodrigues, an entomologist at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History who was not involved with this research.\u00a0 \u201cI can easily see something like that being the precursor of the protrusible gland,\u201d says Rodrigues.\u00a0He notes that since males have thin, hairlike antennae, \u201cthe other way to increase the odds of mate finding would be for females to increase the amount of pheromone released.\u201d Glaw thinks it\u2019s likely that similar glands might exist in the other two species of  Stenophylla , and possibly other mantises. \u201cIf this organ is really an important tool to improve the finding of mates,\u201d he says, \u201cit would be an advantage for many other mantis species as well and might be more widespread.\u201d "},

For the first time, researchers have peered through the transparent exoskeletons of these young mantis shrimp to see  the inner mechanisms of their powerful weapons in motion , researchers report online April 29 in the  Journal of Experimental Biology . The findings are letting scientists in on hidden details of how these speedy armaments work. Mantis shrimp are equipped with special pairs of arms that can explode with bulletlike accelerations to strike at speeds of up to roughly 110 kilometers per hour. Previously, scientists deduced these weapons act much like crossbows. As a latch holds each arm in place, muscles within the arm contract, storing energy within the arm\u2019s hinge. When the crustaceans release these latches,  all this energy discharges at once  ( SN: 8/8/19 ). But researchers didn\u2019t know at what age mantis shrimp first begin launching these spring-loaded attacks.  Computer simulations  predicted that the armaments might be capable of greater accelerations the smaller they got, suggesting young mantis shrimp could actually have faster weapons than adults, says Jacob Harrison, a marine biologist at Duke University. To solve this mystery, Harrison and his colleagues collected a host of microscopic creatures off boat docks in Oahu, Hawaii, sifting out larvae of Philippine mantis shrimp ( Gonodactylaceus falcatus ) roughly the size of rice grains. They then glued the larvae onto toothpicks to record their punches in high-speed video. The researchers also captured a clutch of eggs from the species and raised the hatchlings for 28 days to see how the anatomy of their weaponry developed over time. As soon as nine days after hatching, the larvae began striking rapidly. Their punches flew out at speeds of about 1.4 kilometers per hour. Given their tiny arms \u2014 up to about 100 times shorter than an adult\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s comparable to the speed of an adult shrimp\u2019s punch, Harrison says. More importantly, it\u2019s up to 10 times the swimming speeds of crustaceans and fish roughly as big as the larvae, and more than 150 times those of young brine shrimp that the researchers fed them. These weapons emerged about when the mantis shrimp larvae first begin feeding on live prey, after exhausting the yolk sacs they were born with, Harrison says. \u201cMantis shrimp larvae are capable of moving incredibly quickly for something so small,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cIt is hard for small things to move quickly \u2014 their muscles and body are so tiny, there isn\u2019t really the time or space to build up speed.\u201d Mantis shrimp may need these speedy limbs when they are young \u201cbecause of the water they live in,\u201d Harrison says. Water feels more viscous for tiny creatures than it does for larger ones, so moving through it can prove challenging for microscopic larvae. However, their powerful appendages may overcome this drag to capture prey, he notes. Contrary to what the researchers expected, the larvae were not faster than the adults. For instance, during punches, the larvae swiveled their arms at speeds roughly a third to half those of adult peacock mantis shrimp. These findings suggest there may be some constraints on these weapons at these microscopic sizes that further research can uncover, Harrison says. Alternatively, the larvae may simply not require weapons faster than those of adults \u2014 \u201cthey just need a crossbow that works, and don\u2019t need it to be this crazy superpowerful thing,\u201d says invertebrate neuroecologist Kate Feller at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., who did not take part in this research. The most amazing part of this work, Harrison says, was how he and his colleagues could peer inside the glassy bodies of the larvae to watch how the muscles behaved during a punch, something previously only imagined from surgical dissections and CT scans. \u201cThe fact these larvae are transparent is a great opportunity to answer questions like how the latch works,\u201d Feller says. \u201cThat\u2019s very exciting.\u201d "},

The demand for bulbs is intense, since about 3,500 of them are needed to produce just one kilogram of the powder, worth about $480. But some  Fritillaria  are remarkably difficult to find, with living leaves and stems that are barely distinguishable from the gray or brown rocky background. Surprisingly, this plant camouflage seems to have evolved in response to people.  Fritillaria delavayi  from regions that experience greater harvesting pressure  are more camouflaged than those from less harvested areas , researchers report November 20 in  Current Biology . The new study \u201cis quite convincing,\u201d says Julien Renoult, an evolutionary biologist at the French National Centre for Scientific Research in Montpellier who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice first step toward demonstrating that humans seem to be driving the very rapid evolution of camouflage in this species.\u201d Camouflaged plants are rare, but not unheard of, says Yang Niu, a botanist at the Kunming Institute of Botany in China, who studies cryptic coloration in plants. In wide open areas with little cover, like mountaintops,  blending in can help plants avoid hungry herbivores  ( SN: 4/29/14 ). But after five years of studying camouflage in  Fritillaria , Niu found few bite marks on leaves, and he did not spot any animals munching on the plants. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to have natural enemies,\u201d he says. So Niu, his colleague Hang Sun and sensory ecologist Martin Stevens of the University of Exeter in England decided to see if humans might be driving the evolution of the plants\u2019 camouflage. If so, the more heavily harvested a particular slope, the more camouflaged the plants that live there should be. In an ideal world, to measure harvesting pressure \u201cyou\u2019d have exact measures of exactly how many plants had been collected for hundreds of years\u201d at multiple sites, Stevens says. \u201cBut that data is practically nonexistent.\u201d Luckily, at seven study sites, local herbalists had noted the total weight of bulbs harvested each year from 2014 to 2019. These records provided a measure of contemporary harvesting pressure. To estimate further back in time, the researchers assessed ease of harvesting by recording how long it took to dig up bulbs at six of those sites, plus an additional one. On some slopes, bulbs are easily dug up, but in others they can be buried under stacks of rocks. \u201cIntuitively, areas where it\u2019s easier to harvest should have experienced more harvesting pressure\u201d over time, Stevens says.\u00a0 Both measures revealed a striking pattern: The more harvested, or harvestable, a site, the better the color of a plant matched its background, as measured by a spectrometer. \u201cThe degree of correlation was really, really convincing for both metrics we used,\u201d Stevens says. Human eyes also had a harder time spotting camouflaged plants in an online experiment, suggesting that the camouflage actually works. Hiding in plain sight may present some challenges for the plant. Pollinators might have a harder time finding camouflaged plants, and the gray and brown coloration could impair photosynthetic activity. Still, despite those potential costs, these  F. delavayi  show just how adaptable plants can be, Steven says. \u201cThe appearance of plants is much more malleable than we might have expected.\u201d "},

Trapping crested rats took some experimenting, says ecologist Katrina Nyawira, who worked on the project with Weinstein before moving to Oxford Brookes University in England. \u201cSometimes we\u2019d set traps for about two weeks and just get one individual and, trust me, that would be a win.\u201d Researchers set traps in a weird variety of locations, from remote spots in the Kenyan savanna to behind somebody\u2019s bedroom door, Nyawira and Weinstein realized that the common success factor was access to arrow poison trees ( Acokanthera schimperi). With glossy, green leaves shaped like fat teardrops, this widespread shade tree is a cousin of the North American milkweeds that give monarch butterfly caterpillars their defensive toxins. From roots to shoots, the arrow poison tree carries potent cardenolides that can give would-be predators a heart attack. When Weinstein and Nyawira had trapped a crested rat for a few days of video observation, the researchers tucked some shreds of the deadly tree bark and roots in the temporary cages. Cameras occasionally caught a nocturnal rat touching up its poison hairs. Rather than luxuriate in grooming, the animals got the poison-handling over with in 10 minutes. Weinstein wondered if the 25 animals they caught paid some price for licking toxins: \u201cDo they get sick and have to take a nap to sleep it off?\u201d The videos, however, overall showed no extra naps, no sluggishness or other noticeable changes in behavior after hair care. For crested rats, poison really may be just mousse. How these rats withstand the stuff is an ongoing mystery, with lots of speculation. This species\u2019 stomach, for instance, has chambers more \u201clike a cow\u2026than your typical pizza rat\u2019s,\u201d says Weinstein, now at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. She hadn\u2019t planned to study crested rat home life, but one why-not whim changed that.\u00a0 Weinstein once reset a trap in the same place she had just caught a crested rat. She\u2019d heard that the rats were solitary, so her first catch should have emptied the territory. Yet she quickly caught a second rat in the same spot. \u201cWe put the two rats sort of next to each other,\u201d says Weinstein, \u201cThey start purring \u2014 this vocalization that we\u2019ve never heard before.\u201d \u201cThey very much looked as if they wanted to be together,\u201d she recalls. One was male, the other female. When Weinstein allowed the rats into the same cage, the two started grooming each other. One began following the other around, and the couple eventually retired to the cage\u2019s private retreat, a nest box. Over the course of several months, Weinstein and Nyawira eventually caught four more male-female pairs. Two pairs had youngsters, and each family snuggled together when reunited in captivity. In videos,  pair members stayed close , spending about half of their waking time within just 15 centimeters of each other, the researchers reported online November 17 in the  Journal of Mammalogy. Videos inside the nest box looked especially cozy. Pairs bundled together in nose-to-tail swathes of fluff \u201clike a big scarf,\u201d Nyawira says. Their hair is \u201creally soft, like cat\u2019s fur.\u201d Or as Weinstein puts it: \u201cThey\u2019re super cute.\u201d "},

They become visible only when they reproduce, bursting from their host as a dinner plate\u2013sized flower that smells like rotting flesh. Now, new research on the genetic instruction book of this rare plant reveals the lengths to which it has gone to become a specialized parasite. The findings, published January 22 in  Current Biology , suggest that at least one species of  Sapria  has  lost nearly half of the genes  commonly found in other flowering plants and stolen many others directly from its hosts.\u00a0 The plant\u2019s rewired genetics echo its bizarre biology.  Sapria  and its relatives in the family Rafflesiaceae have discarded their stems, roots and any photosynthetic tissue. \u201cIf you\u2019re out in the forest in Borneo and these [plants] aren\u2019t producing flowers, you\u2019re never even going to know they\u2019re there,\u201d says Charles Davis, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University.\u00a0 For years, Davis has been studying the evolution of this group of otherworldly parasites, which includes the  largest flower in the world,  Rafflesia arnoldii  ( SN: 1/10/07 ). When some genetic data showed a close relationship between these parasites and their vine hosts, Davis suspected horizontal gene transfer. That\u2019s where genes move directly from one species to another \u2014 in this case, from host to parasite. But no one had yet deciphered the genome \u2014 the full genetic instruction book \u2014 for these plants. So Davis and his team sequenced many millions of pieces of  Sapria himalayana \u2019s genome, assembling them into a cohesive picture. When the team analyzed the genome, they found an abundance of oddities.\u00a0 About 44 percent of the genes found in most flowering plants were missing in  S. himalayana . Yet, at the same time, the genome is about 55,000 genes long, more than that of some other nonparasitic plants. The count is inflated by many repeating segments of DNA, the team found. Loss of the chlorophyll pigments responsible for photosynthesis is common in parasitic plants that rely on their hosts for sustenance. But  S. himalayana  appears to have even scrapped all genetic remnants of its chloroplasts, the cellular structures where photosynthesis occurs.\u00a0 Chloroplasts have their own genome, distinct from the nuclear genome that runs a plant\u2019s cells and the mitochondria that produce energy for the cells.  S. himalayana  seems to have lost this genome altogether, suggesting that the plant has purged the last remnants of its ancestral life that allowed it to make its own food. \u201cThere is no other case\u201d of an abandoned chloroplast genome among plants, says Davis. Earlier work by other researchers had suggested  that the genome may be missing . \u201cOur work clearly verifies that indeed it\u2019s totally gone,\u201d he says, noting that even genes in  S. himalayana \u2019s nuclear genome that would regulate components of the chloroplast genome have vanished.\u00a0 It may be too early to declare the chloroplast genome completely missing in action, cautions Alex Twyford, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved with this research. It may be difficult to definitively prove the genome is gone, he says, especially if the chloroplast is \u201cunusual in its structure or abundance\u201d and therefore difficult to identify. Among the remaining parts of the nuclear genome, the team also found that more than 1 percent of  S. himalayana \u2019s genome comes from genes stolen from other plants, likely its current and ancestral hosts. The potential scale of the vanished genome and the volume of repeating bits of DNA are \u201cinsane,\u201d says Arjan Banerjee, a biologist at the University of Toronto Mississauga also not involved with this study. The \u201cindustrial scale\u201d of the plant\u2019s gene theft is also impressive, he says. There are still plenty of weird elements left in  S. himalayana \u2019s genome to explore, says study coauthor Tim Sackton, an evolutionary biologist also at Harvard. For example, the plant has bloated its genome with extraneous DNA, while most parasites streamline their genomes. \u201cThere\u2019s something weird and different going on in this species,\u201d he says, adding that many of the DNA fragments the parasitic plant is stealing from its host don\u2019t appear to encode any genes, and likely don\u2019t do anything important. The new discovery illustrates the level of commitment  S. himalayana  and its relatives have given to evolving a parasitic lifestyle, and provide a comparison to  other extreme plant parasites  ( SN: 7/31/20 ). And for Davis, plants like  S. himalayana  can help researchers determine some of biology\u2019s limits.\u00a0These plants have lost half their genes, yet they still survive, he notes. \u201cMaybe these organisms that stretch the boundaries of existence tell us something about how far the rules can be bent before they can be broken.\u201d "},

The universe is expanding at an accelerating clip, and that evolution, physicists expect, will lead the cosmos to a conclusion. Scientists don\u2019t know quite what that end will look like, but they have plenty of ideas. In  The End of Everything , theoretical astrophysicist Katie Mack provides a tour of the admittedly bleak possibilities. But far from being depressing, Mack\u2019s account mixes a sense of reverence for the wonders of physics with an irreverent sense of humor and a disarming dose of candor. Some potential finales are violent: If the universe\u2019s expansion were to reverse, the cosmos collapsing inward in a Big Crunch, extremely energetic swells of radiation would ignite the surfaces of stars, exploding them. Another version of the end is quieter but no less terrifying: The universe\u2019s expansion could continue forever. That end, Mack writes, \u201clike immortality, only sounds good until you really think about it.\u201d Endless expansion would beget a state known as \u201cheat death\u201d \u2014  a barren universe  that has reached a uniform temperature throughout ( SN: 10/2/09 ). Stars will have burned out, and black holes will have evaporated until no organized structures exist. Nothing meaningful will happen anymore because energy can no longer flow from one place to another. In such a universe, time ceases to have meaning. Perhaps more merciful than the purgatory of heat death is the possibility of a Big Rip, in which the universe\u2019s expansion accelerates faster and faster, until stars and planets are torn apart, molecules are shredded and the very fabric of space is ripped apart. These potential endings are all many billions of years into the future\u2005\u2014\u2005or perhaps much further off. But there\u2019s also the possibility that the universe could end abruptly at any moment. That demise would not be a result of expansion or contraction, but due to a phenomenon called vacuum decay. If the universe turns out to be fundamentally unstable, a tiny bubble of the cosmos could convert to a more stable state. Then, the edge of that bubble would expand across the cosmos at the speed of light, obliterating anything in its path with no warning. In a passage a bit reminiscent of a Kurt Vonnegut story, Mack writes, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s for the best that you don\u2019t see it coming.\u201d Already known for her engaging Twitter personality, public lectures and popular science writing, Mack has well-honed scientific communication chops. Her evocative writing about some of the most violent processes in the universe, mixed with her obvious glee at the unfathomable grandness of it all, should both satisfy longtime physics fans and inspire younger generations of physicists. Reading Mack\u2019s prose feels like learning physics from a brilliant, quirky friend. The book is sprinkled with plenty of informal quips: \u201cI\u2019m not going to sugarcoat this. The universe is  frickin\u2019 weird .\u201d Readers will find themselves good-naturedly rolling their eyes at some of the goofy footnotes and nerdy pop-culture references. At the same time, the book delves deep into gritty physics details, thoroughly explaining important concepts like the cosmic microwave background \u2014 the oldest light in the universe \u2014 and tackling esoteric topics in theoretical physics. Throughout, Mack does an excellent job of recognizing where points of confusion might trip up a reader and offers clarity instead. Mack continues a long-standing tradition of playfulness among physicists. That\u2019s how we got stuck with somewhat cheesy names for certain fundamental particles, such as \u201ccharm\u201d and \u201cstrange\u201d quarks, for example. But she also brings an emotional openness that is uncommon among scientists. Sometimes this is conveyed by declarations in all caps about how amazing the universe is. But other times, it comes when Mack makes herself vulnerable by leveling with the reader about how unnerving this topic is: \u201cI\u2019m trying not to get hung up on it \u2026 the end of this great experiment of existence.  It\u2019s the journey , I repeat to myself. It\u2019s the journey.\u201d Yes, this is a dark subject. Yes, the universe will end, and everything that has ever happened, from the tiniest of human kindnesses to the grandest of cosmic explosions, will one day be erased from the record. Mack struggles with what the inevitable demise of everything means for humankind. By contemplating the end times, we can refine our understanding of the universe, but we can\u2019t change its fate.

A new measurement reveals that the universe is  less clumpy than predicted , physicists report in a series of papers posted July 30 at arXiv.org. The discrepancy could hint at something amiss with scientists\u2019 understanding of the cosmos. To pin down the cosmic clumpiness, researchers studied the orientation of 21 million galaxies with the Kilo-Degree Survey at the Paranal Observatory in Chile. As light from those galaxies streams through the universe, its trajectory is bent by massive objects, a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. This lensing causes the elongated shapes of galaxies to appear slightly aligned, rather than oriented randomly. When combined with additional data from other sky surveys, that alignment quantifies how much the matter in the universe is clumped together. The researchers found that the universe is about 10 percent more homogeneous, or smoother, than predicted based on light released just after the Big Bang, the cosmic microwave background. Previous results had  hinted at the discrepancy , but the new measurement strengthens the case that the disagreement is not a fluke ( SN: 7/30/19 ). If the measurement is correct, the mismatch could hint at a hole in the standard model of cosmology, the theory that describes how the universe has changed over time.

This unidentified stuff , which makes up most of the mass in the cosmos, is invisible but detectable by the way it gravitationally tugs on objects like stars. ( SN: 11/25/19 ). Dark matter\u2019s gravity can also bend light traveling from distant galaxies to Earth \u2014 but now some of this mysterious substance appears to be bending light more than it\u2019s supposed to. A surprising number of dark matter clumps in distant clusters of galaxies  severely warp background light from other objects , researchers report in the Sept. 11  Science . This finding suggests that these clumps of dark matter, in which individual galaxies are embedded, are denser than expected. And that could mean one of two things: Either the computer simulations that researchers use to predict galaxy cluster behavior are wrong, or cosmologists\u2019 understanding of dark matter is. Very high concentrations of dark matter can act like a lens to bend light and drastically alter the appearance of background galaxies as seen from Earth \u2014 stretching them into arcs or splitting them into multiple images of the same object on the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s totally cool. It\u2019s like a fun house mirror,\u201d says astrophysicist Priyamvada Natarajan of Yale University. Judging by computer simulations of galaxy clusters, clumps of dark matter around individual galaxies that are dense enough to cause such dramatic  gravitational lensing  effects should be rare ( SN: 10/4/15 ). Based on cluster simulations run by Natarajan and colleagues, \u201cwe would expect to see 1 [strong lensing] event in every 10 clusters or so,\u201d says study coauthor Massimo Meneghetti, an astrophysicist at the Astrophysics and Space Science Observatory of Bologna in Italy. But telescope images told a different story. The researchers used observations from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Very Large Telescope in Chile to investigate 11 galaxy clusters from about 2.8 billion to 5.6 billion light-years away. In that set, the team identified 13 cases of severe gravitational lensing by dark matter clumps around individual galaxies. These observations indicate there are more high-density dark matter clumps in real galaxy clusters than in simulated ones, Meneghetti says. The simulations could be missing some physics that leads dark matter in galaxy clusters to glom tightly together, Natarajan says. \u201cOr \u2026 there\u2019s something fundamentally off about our assumptions about the nature of dark matter,\u201d she says, like the notion that gravity is the only attractive force that dark matter feels. Richard Ellis, a cosmologist at the University College London who was not involved in the work, thinks the crux of the problem is more likely in the computer simulations than in the nature of dark matter. \u201cA cluster of galaxies is a very dangerous place. It\u2019s like the Manhattan of the universe,\u201d he says \u2014 busy with galaxies whizzing past one another, colliding and getting torn up. \u201cThere\u2019s awful physics that goes into predicting how many of these little lensed things they should find,\u201d Ellis says, so the new result \u201cis intriguing, but my suspicion is that there\u2019s something in the simulations \u2026 that isn\u2019t quite right.\u201d Future observations with the upcoming  Euclid space telescope  ( SN: 11/14/17 ), the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and  Vera C. Rubin Observatory  ( SN: 1/10/20 ) could help clear matters up, says Bhuvnesh Jain, an astrophysicist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the work. \u201cThese three telescopes are going to produce extremely large samples of galaxy clusters,\u201d he says. That may lead to a new understanding of the physics in these turbulent environments, and help determine whether unrealistic simulations are to blame for this dark matter mystery. "},

Astronomers have taken a new census of\nmatter in the universe by examining how bright flashes of radio waves from\nother galaxies, called fast radio bursts, are distorted by particles on their\nway to Earth. This analysis shows that about half of the universe\u2019s ordinary\nmatter, which has eluded detection for decades, is lurking in intergalactic\nspace, researchers report online May 27 in  Nature .  The mystery of the missing matter has\nvexed cosmologists for some 20 years. This elusive material isn\u2019t the invisible,\nunidentified dark matter that makes up most of the mass in the universe. It\u2019s\nordinary matter, composed of  garden-variety particles called baryons , such as protons and neutrons ( SN: 10/11/17 ).  Observations of light emitted when the\nuniverse was young indicate that baryons should make up roughly 5 percent of\nall the mass and energy in the cosmos. But in the modern universe, all the\nmatter that astronomers can easily see, like the stars and gas in galaxies,\nadds up to only about half of the expected amount of matter.  Scientists have long suspected the\nmissing matter is hiding between galaxies, along filaments of gas strung\nbetween galaxy clusters in  a vast cosmic web  ( SN: 1/20/14 ).\n\u201cBut we haven\u2019t been able to detect it very well, because it\u2019s really, really\ndiffuse, and it\u2019s not shining brightly,\u201d says Jason Hessels, an astrophysicist\nat the University of Amsterdam not involved in the new work.  Some intergalactic matter is detectable by how it  absorbs the light of distant, bright objects called quasars  ( SN: 10/25/02 ). But the only way to take inventory of  all the baryons hanging out in intergalactic space relies on  mysterious blasts of radio waves  from other galaxies, possibly generated by energetic activity around neutron stars or black holes ( SN: 2/7/20) .  Even though no one knows what causes\nthese blasts, called fast radio bursts or FRBs, they can make  useful baryon detectors  ( SN:\n7/25/14 ). A burst\u2019s high-frequency, high-energy radio waves zip through\nintergalactic matter faster than its low-frequency waves. The more\nintergalactic matter that a radio burst\u2019s waves pass through, the farther its\nlower-frequency waves fall behind \u2014 creating a detectable smear in the radio\nsignal by the time it reaches Earth.  Astrophysicist J. Xavier Prochaska of the\nUniversity of California, Santa Cruz and colleagues examined five fast radio\nbursts from five galaxies, all detected by the  Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder  ( SN: 6/27/19 ). For each FRB, the researchers compared the\narrival times of radio waves of different frequencies to tally up the number of\nbaryons that the burst encountered on its journey through intergalactic space. Then,\nusing the distance between the FRB\u2019s host galaxy and the Milky Way, Prochaska\u2019s\nteam could calculate the baryon density along that path.  The average density of matter between the\nMilky Way and each of the five FRB host galaxies came out to about one baryon per\ncubic meter. The material in the Milky Way is about 1 million times as dense as\nthat, Prochaska says, making the intergalactic stuff \u201ca very wispy medium.\u201d But\nall that wispy material, taken together, is enough to account for all the\nuniverse\u2019s missing matter \u2014 bringing ordinary matter up to about 5 percent of\nthe modern universe\u2019s overall matter and energy, the researchers say. Astrophysicist J. Michael Shull of the\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder cautions that \u201cfive is an awfully small number\u201d\nof FRB observations from which to draw conclusions about the number of baryons throughout\nthe modern universe. But \u201conce they get their error bars beaten down with many,\nmany more bursts \u2026 I think that will really be the nail in the coffin on this\nbaryon problem,\u201d he says. Using more fast radio bursts as cosmic weigh\nstations will also be useful for pinpointing exactly where all the matter in\nthe universe is located, says Shami Chatterjee, a radio astronomer at Cornell\nUniversity not involved in the work.  Right now, all the researchers can say about\nthe lost-and-found matter is that it\u2019s between galaxies. But with thousands of\nFRB observations, astronomers could start teasing out the slight variations in baryon\ndensity along the sight lines between the Milky Way and other galaxies to map\nout the cosmic web, Chatterjee says.

Two types of measurements clash over  how fast the cosmos is expanding  ( SN: 7/30/19 ). Now, a new estimate from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, or ACT, further entrenches this disagreement. To tease out the properties of the universe, ACT observes light emitted shortly after the Big Bang, known as the cosmic microwave background. Those observations reveal that the universe is expanding a rate of about  67.9 kilometers per second  for each megaparsec (about 3 million light-years), physicists report in  two papers  posted online and submitted to arXiv.org. The number aligns with that of an earlier cosmic microwave background experiment called  Planck  ( SN: 7/24/18 ). \u201cAs an independent experiment, we see the same thing,\u201d says cosmologist Simone Aiola of the Flatiron Institute in New York City. Located in the Atacama Desert in Chile, ACT observes the cosmic microwave background with a higher resolution than Planck did. Both ACT and Planck disagree with most estimates from objects that emitted their light more recently, such as exploding stars called supernovas and bright hearts of galaxies known as quasars. Those studies tend to indicate a faster expansion rate of around 74 kilometers per second per megaparsec. If no simple explanation can be found for the discrepancy, it could dramatically alter physicists\u2019 understanding of the contents of the universe and how the cosmos changes over time. For example, dark energy, the shadowy stuff that causes the universe to expand at an accelerating rate, might behave differently than scientists thought. Some researchers had speculated that an unidentified source of experimental error in the Planck data could have accounted for the mismatch. But with the independent measurement from ACT, that explanation has gone out the window. That frees physicists to focus on other explanations, like potential issues with the supernova or quasar measurements, or the possibility of unexplained new physics phenomena.

A new study in mice finds that immune cells are first trained in the gut to recognize and launch attacks on pathogens, and then  migrate to the brain\u2019s surface to protect it , researchers report online November 4 in  Nature . These cells were also found in surgically removed parts of human brains. Every minute, around 750 milliliters of blood flow through the brain, giving bacteria, viruses or other blood-borne pathogens an opportunity to infect the organ. For the most part, the invaders are kept out by three membrane layers, called the meninges, which wrap around the brain and spinal cord and act as a physical barrier. If a pathogen does manage to breach that barrier, the researchers say, the immune cells trained in the gut are ready to attack by producing a battalion of antibodies. The most common route for a pathogen to end up in the bloodstream is from the gut. \u201cSo, it makes perfect sense for these [immune cells] to be educated, trained and selected to recognize things that are present in the gut,\u201d says Menna Clatworthy, an immunologist at the University of Cambridge. Clatworthy\u2019s team found antibody-producing plasma cells in the leathery meninges, which lie between the brain and skull, in both mice and humans. These immune cells produced a class of antibodies called immunoglobulin A, or IgA. These cells and antibodies are mainly found in the inner lining of the gut and lungs, so the scientists wondered if the cells on the brain had any link to the gut. It turned out that there was: Germ-free mice, which had no microbes in their guts, didn\u2019t have any plasma cells in their meninges either. However, when bacteria from the poop of other mice and humans were transplanted into the mice\u2019s intestines, their gut microbiomes were restored, and the plasma cells then appeared in the meninges. \u201cThis was a powerful demonstration of how important the gut could be at determining what is found in the meninges,\u201d Clatworthy says. Researchers captured microscope images of an attack in the meninges of mice that was led by plasma cells that had likely been trained in the guts. When the team implanted a pathogenic fungus, commonly found in the intestine, into the mice\u2019s bloodstream, the fungus attempted to enter the brain through the walls of blood vessels in the meninges. However, plasma cells in the membranes formed a mesh made of IgA antibodies around the pathogen, blocking its entry. The plasma cells are found along the blood vessels, Clatworthy says, where they can quickly launch an attack on pathogens. \u201cTo my knowledge, this is the first time anyone has shown the presence of plasma cells in the meninges. The study has rewritten the paradigm of what we know about these plasma cells and how they play a critical role in keeping our brain healthy,\u201d says Matthew Hepworth, an immunologist at the University of Manchester in England who was not involved with the study. More research is needed to classify how many of the plasma cells in the meninges come from the gut, he says. The finding adds to growing evidence that gut microbes can play a role in brain diseases. A previous study, for instance, suggested that in mice,  boosting a specific gut bacterium could help fight amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or ALS, a fatal neurological disease that results in paralysis ( SN: 7/22/19 ). And while the new study found the plasma cells in the brains of healthy mice,  previous research has found other gut-trained cells  in the brains of mice with multiple sclerosis, an autoimmune disease of the brain and the spinal cord.\u00a0 For now, the researchers want to understand what cues plasma cells follow in the guts to know it is time for them to embark on a journey to the brain.\u00a0 "},

A month after receiving two doses of the psychedelic drug, 13 people  had big drops in depressive symptoms , researchers report November 4 in  JAMA Psychiatry . Because the study was small and lacked participant diversity, it\u2019s unclear whether the positive results would extend to wider populations. Still, \u201cthe current results are clear,\u201d says Jay Olson, a psychology researcher at Harvard University who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cAt least for some people, psilocybin can reduce depression better than several common treatment options.\u201d Existing antidepressant drugs don\u2019t work well for an estimated 30 to 50 percent of the people who try them; when they do work, the effects can take weeks to kick in. Psilocybin, a compound that can profoundly alter consciousness and perceptions of reality, might be a powerful alternative, says coauthor Roland Griffiths, a neuropsychopharmacologist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. In the new study, patients with moderate or severe depression received two doses of psilocybin pills spaced about a week and a half apart. Participants also received therapy and support from researchers, before, during and after taking psilocybin. A comparison group of 11 people waited eight weeks, then also received the two doses of psilocybin and supportive therapy. This delay allowed the researchers to look for improvements in symptoms that were not related to the drug. Clinicians used a common depression rating scale consisting of 17 items to measure participants\u2019 symptoms. Scores can range from 0 to 52, with higher numbers indicating more severe depression. Before receiving psilocybin, participants who got the drug without delay scored an average of 22.9 points, signaling the high end of moderate depression. Four weeks after the second dose, average scores dropped to 8.5. A score of 7 or below indicates no depression. Scores among the comparison group hovered around 23 while those people waited their turn to get the drug. Overall, 13 of 24 people \u2014 including those who got psilocybin immediately and those who got it later \u2014 met the definition of remission four weeks after their respective treatments. The drops in depression symptoms are substantial compared with those found by some analyses of standard antidepressants, Griffiths says. As with clinical studies in general, positive effects might arise simply from participants\u2019 expectations, not the drug itself. But such effects are unlikely to account for the magnitude of the drop observed, Olson says. The new findings on psilocybin\u2019s antidepressant effects fit with earlier ones: A dose of the drug  eased depression and anxiety in a small group of patients with cancer , effects that lasted for years in some cases, researchers reported in January ( SN: 1/28/20 ). Another study, published in  Lancet Psychiatry  in 2016, found that  signs of depression dropped  in 12 people three months after two doses of psilocybin and psychological support. Overall, the approach is promising, Griffiths says, but questions remain. \u201cWe still need to collect more safety data and we need to know conditions for optimal administration,\u201d he says. Other questions relate to who might benefit from the drug, and who might not, and a diverse study population could help address that. In the new study, however, almost all participants were white; there was just one Asian participant and one African-American participant. \u201cWe really need to think more about who we are including in these studies,\u201d says psychologist Monnica Williams of the University of Ottawa, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. Boosting participation rates among people of color calls for additional effort, particularly in the context of ongoing racial health disparities. A history of negative health care experiences might shape a psychedelic treatment experience, which is sensitive to the setting, Williams says. \u201cA person of color might have a lot of reasons to feel very guarded and anxious in that situation, which is going to make it harder for that approach to be effective,\u201d she says. Of 282 people who participated in psychedelic studies from 1993 to 2017,  the vast majority \u2014 82 percent \u2014 were white , Williams and colleagues reported in a review article published in 2018 in  BMC Psychiatry . \u201cWe\u2019re in the 21st century now,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s just no reason for this anymore.\u201d "},

A recently described fossil of the ocean-dwelling beast reveals that its bite was unlike that of any of its relatives, in the water or onshore.\u00a0 The animal was a mosasaur, an extinct, marine reptile related to snakes and monitor lizards. Mosasaurs commonly had piercing, conical teeth for gripping slippery prey or flat, crushing teeth for smashing hard-shelled animals. But this new variety had short, serrated, squarish blades, packed tightly in series to form a knife\u2019s cutting edge. This mouth of razors is unique among mosasaurs, and even within the entirety of the tetrapod lineage, mostly landlubbing vertebrates that include amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.\u00a0 The discovery, described January 16 in  Cretaceous Research , suggests that mosasaurs were  evolving experimental physical traits and lifestyles right up until their abrupt extinction  66 million years ago.\u00a0 Phosphate miners in Morocco found the curious fossil: a chunk of upper jaw studded with teeth. The jaw came from a mosasaur living at the very end of the Cretaceous Period. Many mosasaurs were massive predators, some stretching longer than a school bus. But this fossil belonged to an animal just over a meter long, Nick Longrich, a paleontologist at the University of Bath in England, and his colleagues determined.\u00a0 Longrich says the animal\u2019s small size is interesting, but that\u2019s not what caught his eye. \u201cThose teeth are just unlike anything I\u2019ve seen in a lizard before,\u201d Longrich says.\u00a0The team named the mosasaur  Xenodens calminechari  \u2014  Xenodens  means \u201cstrange tooth;\u201d  calminechari  is Arabic for \u201clike a saw.\u201d Longrich says the closest match for  X. calminechari \u2019s teeth appear to be those of modern-day dogfish sharks, which can \u201ccut large bolts of flesh out as they scavenge,\u201d he says.\u00a0\u201cProbably these slicing teeth allowed it to process a huge range of foods,\u201d says Longrich, noting that dogfish sharks use their teeth to chop up everything from fish to sea anemones. Despite its small size,  X. calminechari  may have been able to prey upon quite large animals or scavenge their remains, since it shared its watery home with big fish and cephalopods, as well as orca-sized, long-necked plesiosaurs. The fossil is \u201ccompletely bizarre,\u201d says Paulina Jim\u00e9nez-Huidobro, a paleontologist at the University of Bonn in Germany not involved with this research, noting the teeth may have been used to \u201cslice and dice\u201d crustaceans, shell and all.\u00a0 She has doubts about the comparison to shark feeding methods and diet based solely on the tooth shape, though, because of fundamental differences between how sharks and mosasaurs bite prey. Shark teeth cut into flesh on jaws that extend outwards towards prey independently of the skull.\u00a0 \u201cThis mechanism does not occur in mosasaurs, even if  Xenodens  has a shark-like tooth shape,\u201d Jim\u00e9nez-Huidobro says. \u201cNo lizard can do that.\u201d For Longrich,  X. calminechari \u2019s discovery helps paint a picture of the late Cretaceous\u2019 tropical seas as teeming with biodiversity before a  dinosaur-era-ending asteroid  hit Earth ( SN: 6/17/20 ). The ocean ecosystem was thriving at the time, so there may have been dozens of mosasaur species in a single habitat, he says, and they weren\u2019t done producing weird prototypes like  Xenodens .\u00a0 \u201cThe mosasaurs were still experimenting with new ways of feeding, new morphologies, new lifestyles just before that asteroid came down,\u201d Longrich says. Learning more about this nimble, barracuda-like sea lizard will reveal more of the evolutionary experimentation going on at the time, but gaining that understand requires the discovery of more fossil material, which could take a while, Longrich says. In half a dozen years of searching, he\u2019s seen only one fossil of this species. \u201cEventually something has to turn up, but it\u2019s a waiting game.\u201d "},

Actual microbial life-forms are much less likely to become safely fossilized in rocks compared with nonbiological structures that happen to mimic their shapes, new research finds. The finding suggests that Earth\u2019s earliest rocks  may contain abundant tiny fakers  \u2014 minuscule objects masquerading as fossilized evidence of early life \u2014 researchers report online January 28 in  Geology . The finding is \u201cat the very least a cautionary tale,\u201d says study author Julie Cosmidis, a geomicrobiologist at the University of Oxford. Tiny, often enigmatic structures found in some of Earth\u2019s oldest rocks, dating back to more than 2.5 billion years, can offer tantalizing hints of the planet\u2019s earliest life. And the hunt for ever-more-ancient signs of life on Earth  has sparked intense debate  \u2014 in part because the farther back in time you go, the harder it is to interpret tiny squiggles, filaments and spheres in the rock ( SN: 1/3/20 ). One reason is that the movements of Earth\u2019s tectonic plates over time can squeeze and cook the rocks, deforming and chemically altering tiny fossils, perhaps beyond recognition. But an even more pernicious and contentious problem is that such tiny filaments or spheres may not be biological in origin at all. Increasingly, scientists have found that nonbiological chemical processes can create similar shapes, suggesting the possibility of \u201cfalse positives\u201d in the biological record. One such discovery led to the new study, Cosmidis says. A few years ago, she and others were trying to grow bacteria and make them produce sulfur. \u201cWe were mixing sulfides with organic matter, and we started forming these objects,\u201d she says. \u201cWe thought they were formed by the bacteria, because they looked so biological. But then we realized they were forming in laboratory tubes that happened to have no bacteria in them at all.\u201d That led her to wonder about such processes happening in the rocks themselves. So she and others decided to examine what would happen if they tried to re-create the early formation stages of chert, a kind of compact, silica-rich rock common on the early Earth. \u201cMicrofossils are often found in chert formations,\u201d says study coauthor Christine Nims, a geobiologist now at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201cAnything hosted in [chert] will be well-preserved.\u201d Chert forms out of silica-rich water; the silica precipitates out of the water and accumulates, eventually hardening into rock. Cosmidis, Nims and colleagues added sulfur-containing bacteria called  Thiothrix  to solidifying chert to see what might happen during actual fossilization. To other chert samples, they added sulfur-containing \u201cbiomorphs,\u201d spheres and filaments made of tiny crystals but shaped like bacteria. At first, nanoparticles of silica encrusted the bacteria and the biomorphs, Nims says. But after a week or so, the bacteria started to deform, their cells deflating from cylinders into flattened, unrecognizable ribbons as the sulfur inside the cells diffused out and reacted with the silica outside the cells, forming new minerals. The biomorphs, on the other hand, \u201chad this impressive resiliency,\u201d she says. Although they, too, lost sulfur to the surrounding solution, they kept their silica crust. As a result, \u201cthey kept their shape and showed very little change over time.\u201d That endurance suggests that enigmatic structures found in the early rock record have a better chance of being pseudofossils, rather than actual fossils, the team says. The idea that once-living creatures are harder to preserve makes sense, says Sean McMahon, an astrobiologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the new study. \u201cIt\u2019s not totally surprising,\u201d he says. \u201cWe know that biomass does tend to break down quite quickly.\u201d In fact, scientists have known for centuries that  certain chemical reactions can act as \u201cgardens\u201d  that \u201cgrow\u201d strange-shaped mineral objects, twisting into tubes or sprouting branches or otherwise mimicking the weirdness of life. \u201cThere\u2019s a complacency about it, a misconception that we kind of know all this and it\u2019s already been dealt with,\u201d McMahon says. Strategies to deal with this conundrum have included looking for particular structures \u2014 such as  mound-shaped stromatolites  \u2014 or chemical compounds in a potential fossil that are thought to be uniquely formed or modified by the presence of life ( SN: 10/17/18 ). Those criteria are the product of decades of field studies, through which scientists have amassed a vast reference dataset of fossil structures, against which researchers can compare and evaluate any new discoveries. \u201cAnything we find, we can look at through that lens,\u201d McMahon says. But what\u2019s lacking is a similarly rich dataset for how such structures might form in the  absence  of life. This study, he says, highlights that attempts \u201cto define criteria for recognizing true fossils in very ancient rocks are premature, because we don\u2019t yet know enough about how nonbiological processes mimic true fossils.\u201d It\u2019s an increasingly urgent problem with rising stakes, as  NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover  is about to set down on Mars to begin a new search for traces of life in ancient rocks ( SN: 7/28/20 ), he adds. \u201cPaleontologists and Mars exploration scientists should take [this study] very seriously.\u201d "},

With the help of new, precise carbon dating obtained from ancient tree fossils, the researchers correlated shifts in climate patterns, large mammal extinctions and even changes in human behavior just before and during the Laschamps excursion, a brief reversal of the magnetic poles that lasted less than a thousand years. It\u2019s the first study to  directly link a magnetic pole reversal to large-scale environmental changes , the team reports in the Feb. 19  Science . During a reversal, Earth\u2019s  protective magnetic field , which shields the planet from a barrage of charged particles streaming from the sun, can lose strength ( SN: 1/28/19 ). So some researchers have suggested that these flip-flops  may be linked to extinction events  ( SN: 11/19/20 ). But evidence for this has proven elusive. In fact, \u201cthe general belief had been that geomagnetic changes had no impact on climate or anything else,\u201d says Alan Cooper, an evolutionary biologist at BlueSky Genetics in Adelaide. One reason for that belief is a dearth of precise dates for the timing and duration of the geomagnetic event to correlate with environmental, ice core and magnetic rock records. Enter New Zealand\u2019s kauri tree, among the most ancient in the world. The country\u2019s swampy bogs preserve the relics of kauri trees dating as far back as the Laschamps excursion. Cooper and his colleagues obtained cross-sections from four ancient trees recovered from a swamp at Ng\u00ad\u0101wh\u0101 Springs in northern New Zealand, and analyzed them for carbon-14, a radioactive form of carbon. (This is the first paper Cooper has led since he was  fired  from the University of Adelaide in December 2019 for misconduct, allegations which he has denied.) In particular, one massive preserved log dating to about 41,000 years ago offered up a 1,700-year-long carbon-14 record. That record revealed major changes in carbon-14 during the time period running up to and including the Laschamps excursion, the team reports. That makes sense: Increasing incoming cosmic rays \u2014 as would occur with a weakened magnetic field \u2014 also produce more carbon-14 in the atmosphere, a carbon signature which would then become incorporated into the tree\u2019s tissues. The team simulated how a weakened magnetic field might alter atmospheric weather patterns. The computer analysis suggested that the increase of charged particles entering the atmosphere would also increase the production of atmospheric hydrogen and nitrogen oxides \u2014 molecules that tend to consume ozone. That would reduce the ability of stratospheric ozone to shield Earth\u2019s denizens from ultraviolet radiation. The atmospheric changes would also affect how much sunlight is absorbed at different layers in the atmosphere, leading to large-scale changes in weather patterns that would have cooled the planet. Such effects may have in fact occurred at that time. Using the carbon-14 dates from the kauri trees, the team examined sediment, pollen, and other data from before and during the Laschamps excursion that point to sudden cooling at locations from Australia to the Andes. Surprisingly, the most intense effects did not occur during the actual pole reversal, the team found, but in the several hundred years leading up to it, spanning about 42,300 to 41,600 years ago. During the actual reversal, the field was only about 28 percent as strong as it is today. But during that transitional period, field strength shrank to about 6 percent of its current strength. The researchers dubbed this the \u201cAdams Transitional Geomagnetic Event\u201d \u2014 for Douglas Adams, author of  The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy  series. Adams is often associated with the number 42, said in his books to be the answer to \u201cthe ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything.\u201d Scientists have long debated whether climate change or human hunters were more to blame for extinction events that wiped such giant mammals as woolly mammoths and  Diprotodon , a kind of super-sized Australian wombat. \u201cIt was actually one of the motivators for this study,\u201d says study coauthor Chris Turney, a paleoclimatologist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. In  a 2015 study by Cooper, Turney and colleagues , \u201cwe noticed that some of the megafaunal extinctions appear to cluster, and we started asking why,\u201d Turney says ( SN: 7/23/15 ). One such cluster of Australian megafauna extinctions, including the demise of  Diprotodon  and the giant kangaroo  Procoptodon goliah , occurred around 42,000 years ago. The team compared the dates of the magnetic event with previous records from ice cores that can reflect changes in solar activity. These data suggested the solar activity was at a minimum at the time. The combination of a weak magnetic field and this decrease in the sun\u2019s output around the same time \u201ccreated the perfect storm\u201d of climate and broader environmental changes, placing a major stress on megafauna populations, Turney says. Those factors may also have led to increased competition between megafauna and human populations, as well as with Neandertals, he says. Another possible line of evidence for a diminished ozone layer: an increasing abundance of red ochre handprints made by humans in cave paintings, the researchers note. Red ochre is thought to have been  used as a sunscreen  ( SN: 7/3/20 ). There may also have been increasing use of caves between about 42,000 and 40,000 years ago, possibly as shelter from the more intense sun, the researchers report. \u00a0This is the first study to consider such a broad range of environmental consequences of extreme magnetic field changes, says Monika Korte, a geomagnetist at the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences in Potsdam. \u201cThe suggested links seem conceivable to me,\u201d Korte says. But, she adds, \u201cthe biggest value of the paper is that it\u2019s putting out several ideas that should be investigated further.\u201d Whether other magnetic reversals may have prompted similar upheavals in the past remains unknown, but \u201cwe hope the community will look at biological and archaeological datasets through this different lens,\u201d Turney says. Improving the precision of isotopic dating for these events will be key \u2014 and radiocarbon dates gleaned from the New Zealand kauri trees may be able to help with other recent reversals, such as a brief reversal event called the Mono Lake Excursion that occurred about 34,000 years ago. What long-term environmental havoc may have been wreaked by much longer reversal events recorded in ancient rocks, such the 20,000-year-long Brunhes-Matuyama reversal that began 781,000 years ago, is an even more tantalizing question, Cooper says. \u201cThe impacts may have been enormous.\u201d "},

Scientists pinpointed the timing of the dinosaurs\u2019 journey from South America to Greenland by correlating rock layers with sauropodomorph fossils to changes in Earth\u2019s magnetic field. Using that timeline, the team found that the creatures\u2019 northward push\u00a0 coincides with a dramatic decrease in CO 2 , which may have removed climate-related barriers, the team reports February 15 in  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . The sauropodomorphs were  a group of long-necked, plant-eating dinosaurs  that included massive sauropods such as  Seismosaurus  as well as their smaller ancestors ( SN: 11/17/20) . About 230 million years ago, sauropodomorphs lived mainly in what is now northern Argentina and southern Brazil. But at some point, these early dinosaurs picked up and moved as far north as Greenland. Exactly when they could have made that journey has been a puzzle, though. \u201cIn principle, you could\u2019ve walked from where they were to the other hemisphere, which was something like 10,000 kilometers away,\u201d says Dennis Kent, a geologist at Columbia University. Back then, Greenland and the Americas were smooshed together into the supercontinent Pangea. There were no oceans blocking the way, and mountains were easy to get around, he says. If the dinosaurs had walked at the slow pace of one to two kilometers per day, it would have taken them approximately 20 years to reach Greenland. But during much of the Late Triassic Epoch, which spans 233 million to 215 million years ago, Earth\u2019s carbon dioxide levels were incredibly high \u2014 as much as 4,000 parts per million. (In comparison, CO 2  levels currently are about 415 parts per million.) Climate simulations have suggested that level of CO 2  would have created hyper-arid deserts and severe climate fluctuations, which could have acted as a barrier to the giant beasts. With vast deserts stretching north and south of the equator, Kent says, there would have been few plants available for the herbivores to survive the journey north for much of that time period. Previous estimates suggested that these dinosaurs migrated to Greenland around 225 million to 205 million years ago. To get a more precise date, Kent and his colleagues measured magnetic patterns in ancient rocks in South America, Arizona, New Jersey, Europe and Greenland \u2014 all locales where sauropodomorphs fossils have been discovered. These patterns record the orientation of Earth\u2019s magnetic field at the time of the rock\u2019s formation. By comparing those patterns with previously excavated rocks whose ages are known, the team found that sauropodomorphs showed up in Greenland around 214 million years ago. That more precise date for the sauropodomorphs\u2019 migration may explain why it took them so long to start the trek north \u2014 and how they survived journey: Earth\u2019s climate was changing rapidly at that time. Around the time that sauropodomorphs appeared in Greenland, carbon dioxide levels plummeted within a few million years to 2,000 parts per million, making the climate more travel-friendly to herbivores, the team reports. The reason for this drop in carbon dioxide \u2014 which appears in climate records from South America and Greenland \u2014 is unknown, but it allowed for an eventual migration northward. \u201cWe have evidence for all of these events, but the confluence in timing is what is remarkable here,\u201d says Morgan Schaller, a geochemist at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., who was not involved with this study. These new findings, he says, also help solve the mystery of why plant eaters stayed put during a time that meat eaters roamed freely.  \u201cThis study reminds us that we can\u2019t understand evolution without understanding climate and environment,\u201d says Steve Brusatte, a vertebrate paleontologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Edinburgh, also not involved with the study. \u201cEven the biggest and most awesome creatures that ever lived were still kept in check by the whims of climate change.\u201d "},

The clams,  Nymphalucina occidentalis , once lived in what is now South Dakota, where an inland sea divided western and eastern North America. While examining the shells, now at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, paleontologists Adi\u00ebl Klompmaker of the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and AMNH\u2019s Neil Landman spotted telltale oval-shaped holes. Each hole was between 0.5 and 1 millimeters in diameter, thinner than a strand of spaghetti. A modern octopus uses a sharp ribbon of teeth called a radula on its tongue to drill a hole into thick-shelled prey \u2014 useful for when the shell is too tough for the octopus to pop apart with its suckers. The octopus then injects venom into the hole, paralyzing the prey and dissolving it a bit, which makes for easier eating. Octopus-drilled holes were previously found in shells dating to 50 million years ago, but the new find suggests this drilling habit evolved 25 million years earlier in their history. Such drill holes augment the scant fossil record of octopus evolution. The soft bodies of the  clever, eight-armed Einsteins  don\u2019t lend themselves well to fossilization, tending instead to decay away ( SN: 8/12/15 ). What fossils do exist \u2014 a handful of specimens dating to about 95 million years ago \u2014 suggest little change in the basic body plan from ancient to modern octopuses. The find also puts the evolution of octopus drilling squarely within the Mesozoic Marine Revolution, an escalation in the ancient  arms race between ocean predators and prey  ( SN: 6/15/17 ). During the Mesozoic Era, which spanned 251 million to 66 million years ago, predators lurking near the seafloor became adept at crushing or boring holes into the shells of their prey. "},

She and her colleagues wanted to know if light pollution might also increase the disease\u2019s natural spread in the suburbs. Cue the  sentinel chickens  ( SN: 4/9/19 ). The team coupled four years of data from these chickens, kept in coops across the state to monitor the spread of diseases, with a world atlas of artificial night sky brightness. Chickens tested positive for antibodies to West Nile virus more often when there was a little bit of light than in bright light or no light at all, the data showed. \u201cWhere there\u2019s no light pollution, there\u2019s very low exposure risk,\u201d Kernbach says. \u201cAnd then as you move into these areas of dim light pollution, the exposure risk goes way up.\u201d In bright areas, risk drops again.

A new analysis of an anteosaur skull suggests that these hefty reptiles may have been relatively speedy. \u201cThis contradicts what we knew about anteosaurs before,\u201d says Ashley Kruger, a paleontologist at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm. Based on the reptiles\u2019 size, which was around that of today\u2019s hippos or rhinos, researchers had pegged the Permian Period predators as sluggish beasts that waited to ambush prey. The skull of an  Anteosaurus magnificus  appears to tell a different story. Relying on CT scans of fossil skull segments excavated in South Africa, Kruger and his team digitally reconstructed the long, bumpy noggin of a juvenile  A. magnificus . They found that the animal\u2019s inner ears \u2014 bony tubes that help with balance \u2014  dwarfed those of its peer predators . The shape of these bones also suggests that anteosaurs may have benefited from a rather large brain region used to coordinate motion while surveilling prey, the researchers report February 18 in  Acta Palaeontologica Polonica . The team compared  A. magnificus \u2019 skull with that of its head-butting, herbivorous relation  Moschognathus whaitsi . While  M. whaitsi \u2019s skull slopes downward,  A. magnificus  appears to have held its head more level, allowing it to more easily scan the environment. All of these findings suggest that  Anteosaurus  was an agile hunter, Kruger says, with the ability to move quickly and track its prey. These are reasonable conclusions, but \u201cit\u2019s not the smoking gun\u201d that anteosaurs were fleet-footed, says Z. Jack Tseng, a paleontologist at the University of California, Berkeley who was not involved with the work. The study draws on analyses of the inner ears of modern mammals, distant relatives of the group of reptiles that includes anteosaurs. But even in today\u2019s beasts, scientists don\u2019t know exactly how inner ears influence different types of motion. Additional information from the rest of the skeleton would help us better understand how anteosaurs may have moved, he says. Much of what\u2019s known about  Anteosaurus  beyond the skull comes from its close relatives, says Christian Kammerer, a paleontologist at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh who was not part of the study.  Anteosaurus  probably had leaner limbs than related herbivores so it seems that this animal could have been capable of running bursts, he says. \u201cWhether it was an ambush or pursuit predator is a very difficult thing to address, and perhaps unknowable,\u201d given that animals at that time were quite different from modern ones. The swift herbivores of the Serengeti today would outpace  Anteosaurus , Kammerer says, but perhaps the chase was on in a world where big plant-munchers moved like tortoises. "},

Ferns unfurled and flowering shrubs bathed in the sunlight that streamed down through large gaps in the canopy between towering conifers. Then the  bolide hit  and everything changed ( SN: 6/1/20 ). That impact not only set off a massive extinction event that wiped out more than 75 percent of life on Earth, but it also redefined Earth\u2019s tropical rainforests, transforming them  from sun-dappled, open-canopied forests into the dark, dense, lush, dripping forests  of today\u2019s Amazon, researchers report April 2 in  Science . The researchers analyzed tens of thousands of fossils of pollen, spores and leaves, collected from 39 sites across Colombia, that were dated to between 70 million and 56 million years ago. \u00a0The team then assessed overall forest plant diversity, dominant species and insect-plant interactions, and tracked how these factors shifted. Plant diversity declined by 45 percent in the immediate aftermath of the asteroid strike, the researchers found, and it took 6 million years before the rich diversity of the tropical rainforest rebounded. Even then, the forests were never the same. \u201cA single historical accident changed the ecological and evolutionary trajectory of tropical rainforests,\u201d says Carlos Jaramillo, a paleopalynologist \u2014 someone who studies ancient pollen \u2014 at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama City. \u201cThe forests that we have today are really the by-product of what happened 66 million years ago.\u201d Just before the extinction event, tropical forests were a roughly 50-50 mix of angiosperms, or flowering trees and shrubs, and of other plant species such as conifers and ferns. \u201cThe competition for light was not that intense,\u201d Jaramillo says. Afterward, ferns and conifers largely vanished, and angiosperms took over to make up about 90 percent of the plant species in the forest. The reasons why aren\u2019t wholly clear. The region\u2019s climate at the end of the Cretaceous Period 66 million years ago was similar to how it is today: hot and humid. But other factors were likely at work. Huge  plant-eating sauropods , the long-necked dinosaurs, would have helped maintain the open gaps, letting light in, Jaramillo says ( SN: 11/17/20 ). Once the asteroid hit, those dinosaurs were out of the picture. Extinction of certain plant families due to the impact also may have played a role, he says. A third likely factor was a shift in the chemical composition of the forest soil. Frequent rainfall during the warm, wet Cretaceous leached the soils of many nutrients, which would have favored gymnosperms like conifers, says Jaramillo. \u201cThe gymnosperms had this amazing ability to grow with very little food, and could outcompete the angiosperms.\u201d Ashfall fluttering to the ground in the wake of the asteroid impact may have added phosphorus to the soils, effectively fertilizing them, the team suggests. With more food available, angiosperms readily outcompeted the gymnosperms, swiftly growing skyward and blocking out the sunlight. This thick, closed canopy appeared soon after the impact, but overall forest diversity took much longer to recover, as new species began to evolve to occupy new ecological niches. This was also true of the many insect species that had once feasted on the plants, the researchers found. Leaf fossils bear traces of the different types of interactions between herbivorous insects and plants, from creatures that strip leaves to their skeletons to those that drill careful holes through them. \u201cGeneralist\u201d  insects  and other plant-munching groups that can make do with many different types of plants for food \u201cseemed to squeak through largely unaffected,\u201d says coauthor Conrad Labandeira, a paleoecologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. ( SN: 1/25/17 ). \u201cThe specialist interactions that got really creamed were things like leaf miners and piercers and suckers,\u201d which are more dependent on particular plant types, Labandeira says. \u00a0 The recovery path holds a valuable lesson for  the long-lasting impact of modern human activities  such as deforestation, Jaramillo says ( SN: 9/4/20 ). \u201cGenerating new diversity takes geological time,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about planting trees.\u201d This is the first comprehensive picture of what happened in tropical ecosystems right after the extinction event, says paleoecologist Elena Stiles of the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not connected with the study. Most previous work on the chunks of time immediately before and after the extinction event \u2014 the very end of the Cretaceous and the start of the Paleogene Period \u2014 comes  from North America , or from much farther south, such as in Patagonia, Stiles says ( SN: 4/2/19 ). \u201cIn the tropics, there is no place where we have the boundary [between periods] preserved, [and] we have the limitation of a very fragmentary fossil record.\u201d Also striking, Stiles says, is the possibility that this finding may help answer a longstanding question about South America\u2019s astonishing biodiversity. \u201cFor a long time, people have wondered where all of this diversity comes from,\u201d she says. Researchers have speculated, for example, that the continent\u2019s climate or its long isolation from other continents may be responsible. \u201cSo it\u2019s really interesting that this mass extinction event could have been one of the mechanisms that shaped it to be this unique region,\u201d she says.

Monique Smith and Boris Heifets", "date": "January 12, 2021 at 6:00 am", "content": "In pain and pain relief, mice may feel for each other. Research has shown that mice can \u201ccatch\u201d the emotions of an injured or fearful fellow. When some mice are injured, other healthy mice living alongside them  behave as though in pain . Now, a study suggests that not only can pain be passed along, but also  pain relief is contagious  too. In the last decade, researchers have done a lot of work showing that animals can pick up and  share each other\u2019s emotions , particularly fear ( SN: 5/20/19 ), says Monique Smith, a neuroscientist at Stanford University. She and colleagues published their new findings on pain and relief in the Jan. 8  Science . Investigating these building blocks of empathy in animals can help researchers understand human empathy, Smith says, and may someday lead to treatments for disorders that affect the ability to be sensitive to the feelings and experiences of other people. \u201cPain isn\u2019t just a physical experience,\u201d Smith says. \u201cIt\u2019s an emotional experience\u201d as well. In experiments on pairs of mice, one mouse received an injection that caused arthritis-like inflammation in one hind paw while the other mouse was unharmed. After hanging out together for an hour, \u201cthe bystander has it worse than the mouse that got the injection,\u201d says Jeffrey Mogil, a neuroscientist at McGill University in Montreal who was not part of the work.\u00a0 Injected mice acted as though one paw is in pain, as expected, showing extra sensitivity to being prodded there with a plastic wire. Their uninjured companions also showed heightened sensitivity, and in both hind paws. Those mice act as though they\u2019re in the same amount of pain and in more places, Mogil says. \u201cThe behavior is astounding.\u201d In another set of experiments, both mice received the irritating injection, but one also got a dose of soothing morphine. For hours after these mice mingled, the second mouse behaved as though it also got the drug. \u201cYou\u2019ve actually relieved pain in this animal simply by letting it hang out with another animal whose pain was relieved,\u201d says Robert Malenka, a neuroscientist also at Stanford University. In a control group where both mice partners experienced inflammation, the animals\u2019 sensitivity didn\u2019t change after their time together. To understand how these mice pick up on each other\u2019s feelings, Smith, Malenka and their colleague neuroscientist Naoyuki Asada watched which brain regions were active after the mice spent time together. The team saw nerve cells, or neurons, firing in the anterior cingulate cortex, an area important in human empathy and part of the brain region responsible for memory and cognition. The team found neurons connecting this area to other parts of the brain, including the nucleus accumbens, an area that deals with motivation and social behavior. When the scientists disrupted that particular neural connection, \u201cthe animals no longer were able to manifest empathy\u201d for pain or pain relief, Malenka says. The transfer of other emotions between mice may rely on different brain connections. The researchers also examined how mice feel each other\u2019s fear in experiments where mice saw other mice receive an electric shock. The team found that fear transfer relied on connections from the cortex to part of the amygdala, a region known to respond to fear. That suggests that different processes in the brain are involved in different types of empathy. But the differences may also be linked to how mice sense their fellows\u2019 emotions, Mogil says. In the pain and pain relief experiments, mice spend time together sniffing each other, and odors can contain clues to the animals\u2019 feelings. But in the tests on fear, visual cues conveyed animal emotions.\u00a0 \u201cNot surprisingly, the circuits that they\u2019re looking at are remarkably similar to some of these processes in humans,\u201d says Jules Panksepp, a social neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison who was not part of the study. Both mice and humans share a connectedness with their compatriots in emotional situations, he says, and research points to a shared evolutionary basis for empathy. If scientists can home in on the neurochemicals that foster empathic processes, Panksepp says, they may be able to design drugs to treat conditions, such as psychopathy or social personality disorders, that cause empathy to go awry.

His careful, solitary work helped reveal individual cells of the brain that together create wider networks. For those insights, Cajal received a Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine in 1906. Now, a group of embroiderers has traced those iconic cell images with thread, paying tribute to the pioneering drawings that helped us see the brain clearly. The Cajal Embroidery Project was launched in March of 2020 by scientists at the University of Edinburgh. Over a hundred volunteers \u2014 scientists, artists and embroiderers \u2014 sewed panels  that will ultimately be stitched into a tapestry , a project described in the December  Lancet Neurology . Catherine Abbott, a neuroscientist at the University of Edinburgh, had the idea while talking with her colleague Jane Haley, who was planning an exhibit of Cajal\u2019s drawings. These meticulous drawings re-created nerve cells, or neurons, and other types of brain cells, including support cells called astrocytes. \u201cI said, off the cuff, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be lovely to embroider some of them?\u2019\u201d The project had just begun when the COVID-19 pandemic upended the world. But stitching at home amid the shutdowns was a soothing activity, says Katie Askew, a neuroimmunologist at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cHaving something that can occupy your hands so you\u2019re not scrolling through your phone looking at the news is great,\u201d she says. Askew chose to re-create a type of neuron known as a Purkinje cell from a human cerebellum, a structure at the back and bottom of the brain that helps coordinate movement. Purkinje cells collect signals with lush thickets of tendrils, before sending along their own quieting signals. Cajal\u2019s particular specimen nearly filled Askew\u2019s fabric panel. \u201cThey are amazing cells,\u201d she says. Spending months staring at a single cell has led her to spot similar branches in trees, she says. Cajal\u2019s artistic eye is obvious in his drawings, says Annie Campbell, one of the volunteers who contributed a square. \u201cHis images live in this liminal space between science and fine art,\u201d says Campbell, who is herself an artist at Auburn University in Alabama. \u201cHe was making aesthetic decisions about what to leave out so that somebody could look at that and say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s a neuron without all its dendrites so I can see the astrocyte wrapped around it.\u2019\u201d Campbell decided to embroider an astrocyte with looping tendrils \u201cfor the beauty of the shape,\u201d she says. As she sewed, she also began to learn more about the cells, which perform a variety of crucial jobs in the brain, including healing injuries. Cajal\u2019s drawings are still relevant today, says Abbott. \u201cWhat strikes me the most is how completely timeless they are.\u201d Even with powerful, high-resolution microscopes, scientists today see cells in a similar way. \u201cIt\u2019s almost depressing to think that even with all of this fancy equipment, we\u2019re not all that far ahead,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I like that. I like that there is this direct connection to 100 years ago.\u201d That thread ties the embroiderers today to Cajal\u2019s work, Abbott says. \u201cWe are looking at the same thing and feeling the same sense of wonder.\u201d "},

The active component of catnip ( Nepeta cataria ) repels insects by  triggering a chemical receptor that spurs sensations such as pain or itch , researchers report March 4 in  Current Biology . The sensor, dubbed TRPA1, is common in animals \u2014 from flatworms to people \u2014 and responds to environmental irritants such as cold, heat, wasabi and tear gas. When irritants come into contact with TRPA1, the reaction can make people cough or an insect flee.\u00a0 \u00a0 Catnip\u2019s repellent effect on insects \u2014 and its euphoric effect on felines \u2014 has been documented for millennia. Studies have shown that catnip may be  as effective as the widely used synthetic repellent diethyl- m -toluamide , or DEET ( SN: 9/5/01 ). But it was unknown how the plant repelled insects. So researchers exposed mosquitoes and fruit flies to catnip and monitored the insects\u2019 behavior. Fruit flies were less likely to lay eggs on the side of a petri dish that was treated with catnip or its active component, nepetalactone. Mosquitoes were also less likely to take blood from a human hand coated with catnip. Insects that had been genetically modified to lack TRPA1, however, had no aversion to the plant. That behavior \u2014 coupled with experiments in lab-grown cells that show catnip activates TRPA1 \u2014 suggests that insect TRPA1 senses catnip as an irritant. Puzzling out how the plant deters insects could help researchers design potent repellents that may be easier to obtain in developing countries hit hard by mosquito-borne diseases. \u201cOil extracted from the plant or the plant itself could be a great starting point,\u201d says study coauthor Marco Gallio, a neuroscientist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. If a plant can make a chemical that activates TRPA1 in a variety of animals, none are going to eat it, says Paul Garrity, a neuroscientist at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass., who was not involved in the work. Catnip probably didn\u2019t evolve in response to predation from ancient mosquitoes or fruit flies, he says, since plants aren\u2019t on the insects\u2019 main menu. Instead, these insects might be collateral damage in catnip\u2019s fight with some other plant-nibbling insect. The finding \u201cdoes make you wonder what the target is in cats,\u201d says Craig Montell, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara also not involved with the study. The question is not only whether catnip targets TRPA1 in cats but also whether the plant might send signals through different cells \u2014 such as those for pleasure \u2014 in the feline nervous system, Montell says. Luckily, the plant\u2019s bug-off nature doesn\u2019t affect people \u2014 a sign of a good repellent, Gallio says. Human TRPA1 did not respond to catnip in lab-grown cells. Plus, he says, \u201cthe great advantage is that you can grow [catnip] in your backyard.\u201d Though maybe don\u2019t plant catnip in the garden, says study coauthor Marcus Stensmyr, a neuroscientist at Lund University in Sweden. A pot might be better, he says, since catnip can spread like a weed, taking over a garden. "},

M.S. Ponce de Leo\u0301n and C.P.E. Zollikofer/University of Zurich", "date": "April 8, 2021 at 2:00 pm", "content": "Even after ancient humans took their first steps out of Africa, they still unexpectedly may have possessed brains more like those of great apes than modern humans, a new study suggests. For decades, scientists had thought modern humanlike organization of brain structures evolved soon after the human lineage  Homo  arose  roughly 2.8 million years ago  ( SN: 3/4/15 ). But an analysis of fossilized human skulls that retain imprints of the brains they once held now suggests such brain development occurred much later.  Modernlike brains may have emerged  in an evolutionary sprint starting about 1.7 million years ago, researchers report in the April 9  Science . What sets modern humans apart most from our closest living relatives, the great apes, is most likely our brain. To learn more about how the modern human brain evolved, the researchers analyzed replicas of the brain\u2019s convoluted outer surface, re-created from the oldest known fossils to preserve the inner surfaces of early human skulls. The 1.77-million to 1.85-million-year-old fossils are from the Dmanisi archaeological site in the modern-day nation of Georgia and were compared with bones from Africa and Southeast Asia ranging from roughly 2 million to 70,000 years old. The scientists focused on the brain\u2019s frontal lobes, which are linked with complex mental tasks such as toolmaking and language. Early  Homo  from Dmanisi and Africa still apparently retained a great ape\u2013like organization of the frontal lobe 1.8 million years ago, \u201ca million or so years later than previously thought,\u201d says paleoanthropologist Philipp Gunz at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, who did not take part in this study. These findings reveal early humans may have possessed relatively primitive brains even after they first began dispersing from Africa some  2.1 million years ago  ( SN: 7/11/18 ). Modern humans started migrating from the continent about  210,000 years ago  ( S N: 7/10/19 ). Still, it is essential to not underestimate the mental capabilities of early humans, says Marcia Ponce de Le\u00f3n, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Zurich. \u201cThese people ventured out of Africa, produced a variety of tools, exploited animal resources and cared for elderly people, as we know from the site of Dmanisi,\u201d she says. She and colleagues discovered that modern human\u2013like brain organization started appearing in Africa between about 1.5 million to 1.7 million years ago. \u201cI don\u2019t know about anyone else, but I\u2019ve just developed a keen interest in learning everything possible about what hominins were doing during [those] 200,000 years\u201d that drove this apparent brain change, says paleoanthropologist Dean Falk at Florida State University in Tallahassee, who did not take part in the study. The scientists also found that hominids with modern human\u2013like brains appeared in Southeast Asia shortly after 1.5 million years ago, which hints at another dispersal from Africa separate from the first migration about 2.1 million years ago, Ponce de Le\u00f3n says. It remains uncertain whether this second wave merged with or replaced the earlier groups, the researchers note. Much remains controversial about reconstructing the organization of ancient brains from skulls, cautions paleoanthropologist Bernard Wood at George Washington University in Washington D.C., who did not take part in this study. For example, it can prove challenging deducing how the insides of fossil braincases reflected bumps and  grooves on the brain\u2019s surface , or what the  consequences of such brain organization  might have had on brain function ( SN: 4/1/20 ;  SN: 4/25/17 ). \u201cI think this is just the beginning of discussions about what this means, rather than the end,\u201d Wood says. Future research can investigate what evolutionary pressures might have driven the emergence of modern human\u2013like brain organization. Ultimately such research could reveal how brain reorganization is related to the evolution of language and symbolic thought, says study author Christoph Zollikofer, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Zurich. But perhaps there were no such pressures, \u201cand this reorganization was a by-product of changes in other areas,\u201d says paleoanthropologist Am\u00e9lie Beaudet at the University of Cambridge, who wrote  a review  of this study for the April 9  Science . The only way to answer this question \u201cwould be to study more fossils from the time period ranging between the earliest human representatives 2.8 million years ago and  Homo  after 1.8 million years ago and to reconstruct the contexts in which they were living and evolving.\u201d "},

The study looked at different scream types and how listeners perceive them. For example, the team asked participants to imagine \u201cyou are being attacked by an armed stranger in a dark alley\u201d and scream in fear and to imagine \u201cyour favorite team wins the World Cup\u201d and scream in joy. Each of the 12 participants produced seven different types of screams: six emotional screams (pain, anger, fear, pleasure, sadness, and joy) and one neutral scream where the volunteer just loudly yelled the \u2018a\u2019 vowel. Separate sets of study participants were then tasked with classifying and distinguishing between the different scream types. In one task, 33 volunteers were asked to listen to screams and given three seconds to categorize them into one of the seven different screams. In another task, 35 different volunteers were presented with two screams, one at a time, and were asked to categorize the screams as quickly as possible while still trying to make an accurate decision about what type of scream it was, either alarming screams of pain, anger or fear or non-alarming screams of pleasure, sadness or joy. It took longer for participants to complete the task when it involved fear and other alarming screams, and those screams were not as easily recognizable as non-alarming  screams like joy , the researchers report online April 13 in  PLOS Biology . In another experiment, 30 different volunteers underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging, or\u00a0 fMRI, while listening to the screams. Less-alarming screams elicited more activity in the auditory and frontal brain regions than more-alarming screams, the team found, though why we respond that way isn\u2019t yet clear.\u00a0 The study shows that scream communication and the ways in which we understand that vocalization is diverse in humans, compared with other mammals whose screams are usually associated with alarming situations like danger, says Sascha Fr\u00fchholz, a psychologist at the University of Zurich. His team\u2019s work challenges the dominant view in neuroscience that the human brain is primarily tuned to detect negative threat, he says. Though the results are limited only to the experiments and don\u2019t reflect how humans would respond to screams in the real world, the rigor of the study methods provides a high confidence in the results, says Adeen Flinker, neuroscientist at New York University\u2019s School of Medicine not involved in the study. The difference that turned up between alarming and non-alarming screams provides a \u201cdeeper understanding of this important vocalization,\u201d says NYU psychologist David Poeppel, who also was not involved in the study. The range of experiments, from acoustic analysis to fMRI, also provides \u201ca nice next stepping stone to develop a more methodical and mechanistic understanding of how we process screams,\u201d he says.

Under normal circumstances, its waves can travel no faster than  about 36 kilometers per second , physicists propose October 9 in  Science Advances . Sound zips along at different rates in different materials \u2014 moving faster in water than in air for example. But under conditions found naturally on Earth, no material can host sound waves that outpace this ultimate limit,\u00a0which is about 100 times the typical speed of sound traveling in air. The team\u2019s reasoning rests on well-known equations of physics and mathematical relationships.\u00a0 \u201cGiven the simplicity of the argument, it suggests that [the researchers] are putting their finger on something very deep,\u201d says condensed matter physicist Kamran Behnia of \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles in Paris. The equation for the speed limit rests on fundamental constants, special numbers that rule the cosmos. One such number, the speed of light, sets the universe\u2019s ultimate speed limit \u2014 nothing can go faster. Another, known as the fine-structure constant, determines the strength with which electrically charged particles push and pull one another. When combined in the right arrangement with another constant \u2014 the ratio of the masses of the proton and electron \u2014 these numbers yield sound\u2019s speed limit. Sound waves, which consist of the vibrations of atoms or molecules, travel through a material as one particle jostles another. The wave\u2019s speed depends on various factors, including the types of chemical bonds holding the material together and how massive its atoms are. None of the sound speeds previously measured in a variety of liquids and solids surpass the proposed limit, condensed matter physicist Kostya Trachenko and colleagues found. The fastest speed measured, in diamond, was only about half the theoretical maximum. \u00a0 The limit applies only to solids and liquids at pressures typically found on Earth. At pressures millions of times that of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, sound waves move faster and could surpass the limit. One material expected to boast a high sound speed exists only at such high pressures: hydrogen squeezed hard enough to  turn into a solid metal  ( SN: 6/28/19 ). That metal has never been convincingly created, so the researchers calculated the expected speed instead of using a measurement. Above about 6 million times Earth\u2019s atmospheric pressure, the sound speed limit would be broken, the calculations suggest. The role of the fundamental constants in sound\u2019s maximum speed results from how the waves move through materials. Sound travels thanks to the electromagnetic interactions of neighboring atoms\u2019 electrons, which is where the fine-structure constant comes into play. And the proton-electron mass ratio is important because, although the electrons are interacting, the nuclei of the atoms move as a result. The fine-structure constant and the proton-electron mass ratio are dimensionless constants, meaning there are no units attached to them (so their value does not depend on any particular system of units). Such dimensionless constants  fascinate physicists , because the values are crucial to the existence of the universe as we know it ( SN: 11/2/16 ). For example, if the fine-structure constant were significantly altered, stars, planets and life couldn\u2019t have formed. But no one can explain why these all-important numbers have the values they do. \u201cWhen I have sleepless nights, I sometimes think about this,\u201d says Trachenko, of Queen Mary University of London. So he and colleagues are extending this puzzle from the cosmic realm to more commonplace concepts like the speed of sound. Trachenko and coauthor Vadim Veniaminovich Brazhkin of the Institute for High Pressure Physics, in Troitsk, Russia, also reported a  minimum possible viscosity  for liquids in the April 24  Science Advances. That viscosity limit depends on the Planck constant, a number at the heart of quantum mechanics, the math that governs physics on very small scales. If the Planck constant were 100 times larger, Trachenko says, \u201cwater would be like honey, and that probably would be the end of life because the processes in cells would not flow as efficiently.\u201d "},

Adam Fenster", "date": "October 14, 2020 at 11:00 am", "content": "It\u2019s here: Scientists have reported the discovery of the first room-temperature superconductor, after more than a century of waiting. The discovery evokes daydreams of futuristic technologies that could reshape electronics and transportation. Superconductors transmit electricity without resistance, allowing current to flow without any energy loss. But all superconductors previously discovered must be cooled, many of them to very low temperatures, making them impractical for most uses. Now, scientists have found the first superconductor that operates at room temperature \u2014 at least given a fairly chilly room. The material is superconducting below temperatures of about 15\u00b0 Celsius (59\u00b0 Fahrenheit), physicist Ranga Dias of the University of Rochester in New York and colleagues report October 14 in  Nature . The team\u2019s results \u201care nothing short of beautiful,\u201d says materials chemist Russell Hemley of the University of Illinois at Chicago, who was not involved with the research. However, the new material\u2019s superconducting superpowers appear only at extremely high pressures, limiting its practical usefulness. Dias and colleagues formed the superconductor by squeezing carbon, hydrogen and sulfur between the tips of two diamonds and hitting the material with laser light to induce chemical reactions. At a pressure about 2.6 million times that of Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and temperatures below about 15\u00b0 C, the electrical resistance vanished. That alone wasn\u2019t enough to convince Dias. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe it the first time,\u201d he says. So the team studied additional samples of the material and investigated its magnetic properties. Superconductors and magnetic fields are known to clash \u2014 strong magnetic fields inhibit superconductivity. Sure enough, when the material was placed in a magnetic field, lower temperatures were needed to make it superconducting. The team also applied an oscillating magnetic field to the material, and showed that, when the material became a superconductor, it expelled that magnetic field from its interior, another sign of superconductivity. The scientists were not able to determine the exact composition of the material or how its atoms are arranged, making it difficult to explain how it can be superconducting at such relatively high temperatures. Future work will focus on describing the material more completely, Dias says. When superconductivity was discovered in 1911, it was found only at temperatures close to absolute zero (\u2212273.15\u00b0 C). But since then, researchers have steadily uncovered materials that superconduct at higher temperatures. In recent years, scientists have accelerated that progress by focusing on hydrogen-rich materials at high pressure. In 2015, physicist Mikhail Eremets of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany, and colleagues  squeezed hydrogen and sulfur  to create a superconductor at temperatures up to \u221270\u00b0 C ( SN: 12/15/15 ). A few years later, two groups, one led by Eremets and another involving Hemley and physicist Maddury Somayazulu, studied a high-pressure  compound of lanthanum and hydrogen . The two teams found evidence of superconductivity at even higher temperatures of \u221223\u00b0 C and \u221213\u00b0 C, respectively, and in some samples possibly as high as 7\u00b0 C ( SN: 9/10/18 ). The discovery of a room-temperature superconductor isn\u2019t a surprise. \u201cWe\u2019ve been obviously heading toward this,\u201d says theoretical chemist  Eva Zurek  of the University at Buffalo in New York, who was not involved with the research. But breaking the symbolic room-temperature barrier is \u201ca really big deal.\u201d If a room-temperature superconductor could be used at atmospheric pressure, it could save vast amounts of energy lost to resistance in the electrical grid. And it could improve current technologies, from MRI machines to quantum computers to magnetically levitated trains. Dias envisions that humanity could become a \u201csuperconducting society.\u201d But so far scientists have created only tiny specks of the material at high pressure, so practical applications are still a long way off. Still, \u201cthe temperature is not a limit anymore,\u201d says Somayazulu, of Argonne National Laboratory in Lemont, Ill., who was not involved with the new research. Instead, physicists now have a new aim: to create a room-temperature superconductor that works without putting on the squeeze, Somayazulu says. \u201cThat\u2019s the next big step we have to do.\u201d "},

David Kisailus", "date": "October 21, 2020 at 11:00 am", "content": "The diabolical ironclad beetle is like a tiny tank on six legs. This insect\u2019s rugged exoskeleton is so tough that the beetle can survive getting run over by cars, and many would-be predators don\u2019t stand a chance of cracking one open.  Phloeodes diabolicus  is basically nature\u2019s jawbreaker. Analyses of microscope images, 3-D printed models and computer simulations of the beetle\u2019s armor have now revealed  the secrets to its strength . Tightly interlocked and impact-absorbing structures that connect pieces of the beetle\u2019s exoskeleton help it survive enormous crushing forces, researchers report in the Oct. 22  Nature . Those features could inspire new, sturdier designs for things such as body armor, buildings, bridges and vehicles. The diabolical ironclad beetle, which dwells in desert regions of western North America, has a distinctly hard-to-squish shape. \u201cUnlike a stink beetle, or a Namibian beetle, which is more rounded \u2026 it\u2019s low to the ground [and] it\u2019s flat on top,\u201d says David Kisailus, a materials scientist at the University of California, Irvine. In compression experiments, Kisailus and colleagues found that the beetle could withstand around 39,000 times its own body weight. That would be like a person shouldering a stack of about 40 M1 Abrams battle tanks. Within the diabolical ironclad beetle\u2019s own tanklike physique, two key microscopic features help it withstand crushing forces. The first is a series of connections between the top and bottom halves of the exoskeleton. \u201cYou can imagine the beetle\u2019s exoskeleton almost like two halves of a clamshell sitting on top of each other,\u201d Kisailus says. Ridges along the outer edges of the top and bottom latch together. But those ridged connections have different shapes across the beetle\u2019s body. Near the front of the beetle, around its vital organs, the ridges are highly interconnected \u2014 almost like zipper teeth. Those connections are stiff and resist bending under pressure. The connective ridges near the back of the beetle, on the other hand, are not as intricately interlocked, allowing the top and bottom halves of the exoskeleton to slide past each other slightly. That flexibility helps the beetle absorb compression in a region of its body that is safer to squish. The second key feature is a rigid joint, or suture, that runs the length of the beetle\u2019s back and connects its left and right sides. A series of protrusions, called blades, fit together like jigsaw puzzle pieces to join the two sides. These blades contain layers of tissue glued together by proteins, and are highly damage-resistant. When the beetle is squashed, tiny cracks form in the protein glue between the layers of each blade. Those small, healable fractures allow the blades to absorb impacts without completely snapping, explains Jesus Rivera, an engineer at UC Irvine. This toughness makes the diabolical ironclad beetle pretty predator-proof. An animal might be able to make a meal out of the beetle by swallowing it whole, Kisailus says. \u201cBut the way it\u2019s built, in terms of other predation \u2014 let\u2019s say like a bird that\u2019s pecking at it, or a lizard that\u2019s trying to chew on it \u2014 the exoskeleton would be really hard\u201d to crack. That hard exterior is also a nuisance for insect collectors. The diabolical ironclad beetle is notorious among entomologists for being so fantastically durable that it bends the steel pins usually used to mount insects for display, says entomologist Michael Caterino of Clemson University in South Carolina. But \u201cthe basic biology of this thing is not particularly well-known,\u201d he says. \u201cI found it fascinating\u201d to learn what makes the beetle so indestructible. The possibility of using beetle-inspired designs for sturdier airplanes and other structures is\u00a0intriguing, Caterino adds. And with the splendid variety of insects all over the world, who knows what other critters might someday inspire clever engineering designs. "},

Normally, the carnivorous  Dionaea muscipula   scores a meal  when unsuspecting prey touches delicate hairs on one of the plant\u2019s jawlike leaves, triggering the trap to snap shut ( SN: 10/14/20 ). But by sticking electrodes to the leaves and applying a small electric voltage, researchers designed a method to force Venus flytraps to close. Even when cut from the plant, the leaves retained the ability to shut upon command for up to a day, say materials scientist Wenlong Li and colleagues at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Integrating soft, flexible plant material into robotics could aid in picking up fragile objects that would otherwise be damaged by clunky, rigid graspers, the researchers say. So, Li\u2019s team attached a piece of a flytrap to a robotic arm and used a smartphone app to control the trap. In experiments, the robotic grabber clutched a piece of wire one-half of a millimeter in diameter. And when not strapped to the robotic arm, the dismembered plant also caught a slowly moving 1-gram weight. One drawback: The traps take hours to reopen, meaning this bot had better make the catch on the first try. "},

Les Triconautes/Unsplash", "date": "January 26, 2021 at 10:00 am", "content": "Physicist Elisabetta Matsumoto is an avid knitter and has been since taking up the hobby as a child. During graduate school at the University of Pennsylvania in 2009, Matsumoto came across an unusually knotty stitch while knitting a pattern for a Japanese red dragon. \u201cI have books with thousands of different stitch patterns, but the one in the red dragon wall hanging was one I had never seen,\u201d she says. That got her thinking about the geometry of stitches and, eventually, led her to study the mathematics of knitting. There are a hundred or so basic stitches, Matsumoto says. By varying stitch combinations, a knitter can alter the elasticity, mechanical strength and 3-D structure of the resulting fabric. Yarn on its own isn\u2019t very elastic. But when knitted, the yarn gives rise to fabric that can stretch by more than twice its length while the yarn itself barely stretches. Matsumoto, now at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, is teasing out the mathematical rules that dictate how stitches impart such unique properties to fabrics. She hopes to develop a catalog of stitch types, their combinations and the resulting fabric properties. Knitters, scientists and manufacturers could all benefit from a dictionary of knits, she says. Matsumoto\u2019s research builds on  knot theory  ( SN: 10/31/08 ), a set of mathematical principles that define how knots form. These principles have helped explain how  DNA folds and unfolds  and how a  molecule\u2019s makeup  and distribution in space impart it with physical and chemical characteristics ( SN: 5/23/08; SN: 8/27/18 ). Matsumoto is using knot theory to understand how each stitch entangles with its neighbors. \u201cThe types of stitches, the differences in their geometries as well as the order in which you put those stitches together into a textile may determine [the fabric\u2019s] properties,\u201d she says. Making tiny changes, such as altering a couple of crossings in a knot, could have  a huge impact on the mechanics of the textile . For instance, a fabric made of just one stitch type, such as a knit or purl, tends to curl at the edges. But combine the two stitch types together in alternating rows or columns, and the fabric lays flat. And despite looking nearly identical, the fabrics have varying degrees of stretchiness, Matsumoto and grad student Shashank Markande reported in July in the  Bridges 2020 Conference Proceedings . Matsumoto\u2019s team is now training a computer to think like a knitter. Using yarn properties, mathematical stitch details and final knitted structures as inputs, a program can predict mechanical properties of fabrics. These predictions could someday help tailor materials for specific applications \u2014 from scaffolds for growing human tissue to  wearable smart clothing  ( SN: 6/1/18 ) \u2014 and perhaps solve knotty problems of everyday life.

The team, led by roboticist Guorui Li of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China,  successfully field-tested the robot\u2019s ability to swim  at depths ranging from 70 meters to nearly 11,000 meters, it reports March 4 in  Nature . Challenger Deep is the lowest of the low, the  deepest part of the Mariana Trench . It bottoms out at about 10,900 meters below sea level ( SN: 12/11/12 ). The pressure from all that overlying water is about a thousand times the atmospheric pressure at sea level, translating to about 103 million pascals (or 15,000 pounds per square inch). \u201cIt\u2019s about the equivalent of an elephant standing on top of your thumb,\u201d says deep-sea physiologist and ecologist Mackenzie Gerringer of State University of New York at Geneseo, who was not involved in the new study. The tremendous pressures at these hadal depths \u2014 the deepest ocean zone, between 6,000 and 11,000 meters \u2014 present a tough engineering challenge, Gerringer says. Traditional deep-sea robots or manned submersibles are heavily reinforced with rigid metal frames so as not to crumple \u2014 but these vessels are bulky and cumbersome, and the risk of structural failure remains high. To design robots that can maneuver gracefully through shallower waters, scientists have previously looked to soft-bodied ocean creatures,  such as the octopus , for inspiration ( SN: 9/17/14 ). As it happens, such a deep-sea muse also exists:  Pseudoliparis swirei , or the Mariana hadal snailfish, a mostly squishy, translucent fish that lives as much as 8,000 meters deep in the Mariana Trench. Gerringer, one of the researchers who first described the deep-sea snailfish in 2014,  constructed a 3-D printed soft robot version  of it several years later to better understand how it swims. Her robot contained a synthesized version of the watery goo inside the fish\u2019s body that most likely adds buoyancy and helps it swim more efficiently ( SN: 1/3/18 ). But devising a robot that can swim under extreme pressure to investigate the deep-sea environment is another matter. Autonomous exploration robots require electronics not only to power their movement, but also to perform various tasks, whether testing water chemistry, lighting up and filming the denizens of deep ocean trenches, or collecting samples to bring back to the surface. Under the squeeze of water pressure, these electronics can grind against one another. So Li and his colleagues decided to borrow one of the snailfish\u2019s adaptations to high-pressure life: Its skull is not completely fused together with hardened bone. That extra bit of malleability allows the pressure on the skull to equalize. In a similar vein, the scientists decided to distribute the electronics \u2014 the \u201cbrain\u201d \u2014 of their robot fish farther apart than they normally would, and then encase them in soft silicone to keep them from touching. The team also designed a soft body that slightly resembles the snailfish, with two fins that the robot can use to propel itself through the water. (Gerringer notes that the actual snailfish doesn\u2019t flap its fins, but wriggles its body like a tadpole.) To flap the fins, the robot is equipped with batteries that power artificial muscles: electrodes sandwiched between two membranes that deform in response to the electrical charge. The team tested the robot in several environments: 70 meters deep in a lake; about 3,200 meters deep in the South China Sea; and finally, at the very bottom of the ocean. The robot was allowed to swim freely in the first two trials. For the Challenger Deep trial, however, the researchers kept a tight grip, using the extendable arm of a deep-sea lander to hold the robot while it flapped its fins. This machine \u201cpushes the boundaries of what can be achieved\u201d with biologically inspired soft robots, write robotocists Cecilia Laschi of the National University of Singapore and Marcello Calisti of the University of Lincoln in England. The pair have a commentary on the research in the same issue of  Nature . That said, the machine is still a long way from deployment, they note. It swims more slowly than other underwater robots, and doesn\u2019t yet have the power to withstand powerful underwater currents. But it \u201clays the foundations\u201d for future such robots to help answer lingering questions about these mysterious reaches of the ocean, they write. Deep-sea trenches are known to be teeming with microbial life, which happily feed on the bonanza of organic material \u2014 from algae to animal carcasses \u2014 that finds its way to the bottom of the sea. That microbial activity hints that the trenches may play a significant role in Earth\u2019s carbon cycle, which is in turned linked to the planet\u2019s regulation of its climate. The discovery of  microplastics in Challenger Deep  is also incontrovertible evidence that even the bottom of the ocean isn\u2019t really that far away, Gerringer says ( SN: 11/20/20 ). \u201cWe\u2019re impacting these deep-water systems before we\u2019ve even found out what\u2019s down there. We have a responsibility to help connect these seemingly otherworldly systems, which are really part of our planet.\u201d "},

But in March 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic progressed, he and colleagues from the National Institute for Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, Md., felt a strong desire to contribute to beating back the virus. So they started studying face-covering materials instead. Using a scanning electron microscope, Vicenzi and colleagues have examined dozens of materials, including coffee filters, pillowcases, surgical masks and N95 masks. In 2020, the team found that  N95 respirator masks are the most effective  at providing protection from aerosols like the ones in which SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, travels. And the researchers reported that synthetic fabrics, like chiffon or rayon, don\u2019t trap as many particles as tightly woven cotton flannels. Microscopic textures can explain each fabric\u2019s ability to filter out aerosols. The random nature of cotton fibers \u2014 with its wrinkled texture and complex shapes such as kinks, bends and folds \u2014 probably allows cotton to trap more nanoscale particles than other fabrics, Vicenzi says. In contrast, polyester fabrics have highly organized, mostly straight and smooth fibers, which makes them less efficient as face masks. Cotton flannels also provide additional protection  by absorbing moisture from breath , Vicenzi and colleagues report March 8 in  ACS Applied Nano Materials . \u201cSince cotton loves water, it swells up in humid environments, and that makes it harder for particles to make their way through a mask,\u201d says Vicenzi. Polyester and nylon masks, on the other hand, \u201crepel water from your breath, so there\u2019s no added benefit.\u201d Through his work, Vicenzi has explored the unseen world of face-covering materials. Some textiles remind him of food, such as rayon\u2019s fibers that resemble the texture of rigatoni pasta. Others, like wool, remind him of atmospheric patterns such as the swirl of a hurricane. Vicenzi plans to keep observing face masks up close. And he hopes his research helps people decide how to best protect themselves and others during the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to use an effective material for a mask if you can,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, wearing any mask compared to none at all makes the biggest difference in slowing the spread of pathogens.\u201d "},

Genetic material from ancient mammoth molars found in Siberia handily beats the  previous record set by 700,000-year-old DNA from a frozen, fossilized horse  ( SN: 6/26/13 ). Some mammoth gene snippets suggest that ancient mammoths already had the traits that allowed them to withstand cold temperatures during later ice ages. What\u2019s more, some hairy behemoths that inhabited North America may have been a  hybrid mix between the woolly mammoth and a previously unknown mammoth species , researchers report February 17 in  Nature . The findings \u201creally highlight the exciting times that we live in,\u201d says Charlotte Lindqvist, an evolutionary biologist at the University at Buffalo in New York who was not involved in the work. \u201cWe can get genetic data \u2014 we can recover DNA \u2014 from such ancient samples that can directly give us windows into the past.\u201d Such data can reveal how extinct animals evolved, adding to the clues that come from physically examining ancient bones. The mammoth DNA was extracted from three molars unearthed in the 1970s from permafrost in northeast Siberia. Though DNA degrades into shorter strings of genetic material over time, making it difficult to handle and piece together, cold permafrost helps to protect genetic information from rapidly falling apart. Theoretical studies had suggested that researchers  could perhaps recover DNA that is more than 1 million years old . Still, the recovered DNA is \u201cquite close to the limit of what is possible,\u201d says Love Dal\u00e9n, an evolutionary geneticist at the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm. The two oldest specimens, dubbed Krestovka and Adycha, lived around 1.2 million to 1 million years ago, Dal\u00e9n and colleagues found. The third, called Chukochya, dates back 800,000 to 500,000 years. Genetic analyses of ancient DNA recovered from these specimens \u2014 as well as DNA from other mammoths and present-day elephants \u2014 suggest that Krestovka and Adycha belonged to two different mammoth species. Researchers had previously thought that only one type of mammoth, called the steppe mammoth ( Mammuthus trogontherii) , lived in Siberia 1 million years ago. While Adycha was part of the steppe mammoth lineage that eventually gave rise to woolly mammoths, the Krestovka mammoth may have diverged from its relatives more than 2 million years ago and could represent an unknown line of mammoths, the researchers found. That unidentified species might have mixed with woolly mammoths to give rise to the Columbian mammoth ( M. columbi ) \u2014 which roamed North America \u2014 at least 420,000 years ago. The younger Chukochya may have been an early woolly mammoth ( M. primigenius ). The study adds to the amount of mammoth genetic material researchers have decoded and expands the geographic range where such mammoth samples have come from, says Vincent Lynch, an evolutionary biologist at the University at Buffalo, who was not involved in the work. Analyzing the genetics of many mammoths from varied locations is \u201cimportant if you want to make statements about how mammoths came to be mammoths, why they look the way they do and how diverse they were,\u201d Lynch says. Traits such as shaggy hair, which probably helped mammoths  handle the cold , are ancient, the team found ( SN: 7/2/15 ) .  The Adycha and Chukochya mammoths already had the genetic tweaks for many of these traits, hinting that the hairy animals adapted slowly to the chill of ice ages over hundreds of thousands of years. \u201cA lot of the mutations which we think make mammoths mammoths \u2014 small ears, lots of fat, not sensitive to cold \u2014 happened before they got into that environment,\u201d Lynch says. Still, while the new results are intriguing, ancient DNA is fragile and there\u2019s a limit to how much data researchers can get from old specimens, Lindqvist says. So the findings are unlikely to be the full story, she says.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 "},

For each copy of the Neandertal haplotype a person inherited, the  risk of needing intensive care fell approximately 22 percent , researchers report in the March 2  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

The protective variants are largely absent among people in sub-Saharan Africa, where few people carry genes inherited from Neandertals. About 25 to 30 percent of present-day people of Asian and European ancestry carry the protective variants. Some Black people in the Americas also inherited the protective haplotype, presumably from Asian, European or Native American ancestors.

The Human Genome Project \u2014 which built the blueprint, called the human reference genome \u2014 has changed the way medical research is conducted, says Ting Wang, a geneticist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. \u201cIt\u2019s highly, highly valuable.\u201d For instance, before the project, drugs were developed by serendipity, but having the master blueprint led to the development of therapies that could specifically target certain biological processes. As a result, more than 2,000 drugs aimed at specific human genes or proteins have been approved. The reference genome has also made it possible to untangle complicated networks involved  in regulating gene activity  ( SN: 9/5/12 ) and learn more about how  chemical modifications to DNA  tweak that activity ( SN: 2/18/15 ). It has also led to the discovery of thousands of genes that don\u2019t make proteins, but instead make many different  useful RNAs  ( SN: 4/7/19 ). Researcher  lay out those accomplishments and others  February 10 in  Nature . \u201cThat said, the human reference genome we use has certain limitations,\u201d Wang says. For one thing, it isn\u2019t really finished; gaps remain in the more than 3 billion DNA letter long template, especially in stretches of repetitive DNA. Those are holes where the technology that built the reference doesn\u2019t do a good job of reading every letter. Scientists know there is DNA there, just not how much nor how the letters are arranged. And despite being a compilation of more than 60 people\u2019s DNA, the reference doesn\u2019t fully encapsulate the full range of human genetic diversity. One of the easiest ways to compile a complete catalog of human diversity is to decipher, or  sequence, the genomes of 3 million Africans , medical geneticist Ambroise Wonkam of the University of Cape Town in South Africa, proposes in a commentary also published February 10 in  Nature . Africa is where modern humans originated, and study after study has uncovered thousands to millions of new genetic variants among people of African descent For instance, the Human Health and Heredity in Africa project, known as  H3Africa , uncovered more than  3 million never-before-seen single letter variants  \u2014 known as SNPs, short for single nucleotide polymorphisms \u2014 by examining DNA of just 426 people from different parts of Africa, researchers reported October 28 in  Nature . Researchers won\u2019t just find single DNA letter, or base, changes when they examine African genomes, Wonkam says. They may discover lots of DNA that no one expected was even in the human genome. Even healthy humans are sometimes  missing big chunks of DNA  ( SN: 10/22/09 ). And some people may have more DNA than others. In a 2019  study of 910 people of African descent , researchers discovered an additional 296.5 million DNA bases that aren\u2019t in the current reference. That suggests sequencing Africans might uncover 10 percent or more of the human genome that hasn\u2019t previously been cataloged. That bonus genetic material isn\u2019t necessarily in the gaps researchers already knew about. It hasn\u2019t been found because the 60 or so people whose DNA comprises the reference just didn\u2019t happen to carry it. \u201cWe need a database reference that is representative of humankind,\u201d that is rooted in African origins, Wonkam says. \u201cAfrican population genomic variation is the next frontier\u201d in human genetics. That doesn\u2019t mean researchers should stop studying people from other parts of the world, he says. A project to examine the genetics of Icelanders, for instance, may uncover genetic variants that arose among the founders of that island nation and are still carried by people today. But genetic diversity that was present in modern humans before the ancestors of Eurasians left Africa thousands of years ago is still present in people on that continent today, and more variants have arisen as people adapted to specific environments or just by chance. Research on genetic variation in Africa is sure to help Africans better understand their health problems. But a reference that encompasses the full range of human genetic diversity will help everyone in the world, Wonkam says. Already, new cholesterol-lowering drugs and other medical advances have come from studying the DNA of people of African descent. While Wonkam\u2019s proposal may solve the genetic diversity problem, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mend gaps in the existing reference genome. The current reference genome was made by fitting together small strings of DNA like thousands of tiny jigsaw puzzle pieces. In some parts of the genome, the DNA sequence is repeated over and over again, producing virtually identical puzzle pieces. It\u2019s hard to know exactly where all those pieces go and how many repetitions there are. So some repetitive pieces have been left out, leaving holes in the finished puzzle. That can create problems, Wang says. For instance, doctors may sequence the DNA of a patient and find a genetic variant they suspect might be causing a health problem. But if the suspect DNA isn\u2019t in the current reference, there\u2019s no way to know whether the variant is harmful or not. \u201cIt is time to fully address this problem [with] the limitations of the current human genome assembly,\u201d Wang says. To do that, Wang and other scientists with the  Human Pangenome Reference Consortium  will use new DNA deciphering technology, called long-range or long-read sequencing, to read each human chromosome from end to end. In 2020, researchers reported the first fully complete sequence of a human chromosome, the X chromosome. That effort  closed 29 gaps  in the reference sequence for that chromosome, including 3.1 million bases spanning the centromere, the part of the chromosome important for separating chromosomes during cell division, researchers reported July 14 in  Nature . Learning more about centromeres may help researchers understand why chromosome division sometimes goes wrong, leading to cancer or genetic conditions such as Down syndrome. \u00a0 That early success suggests that long-read sequencing technology can fill in the gaps in the reference genome, and help find the missing 10 percent of DNA. The pangenome team hopes to assemble complete genomes for 350 people from around the world. And when he says complete, Wang means complete. The reference genome contains more than 3 billion DNA bases, but human cells have more than 6 billion bases. The discrepancy comes from representing just one set of chromosomes instead of the two sets people actually inherit, one from each parent. That\u2019s because when the DNA was originally sequenced with a person\u2019s DNA being cut into tiny pieces for reassembly later, there was no way to distinguish which little piece came from the chromosome inherited from a person\u2019s mother from the one inherited from the father. So it was all mushed into one. But by sequencing each chromosome in its entirety, researchers will be able to construct a full picture of a person\u2019s genome, including determining exactly what came from each parent. Those full pictures may allow researchers to better follow patterns of inheritance and track down genetic source of diseases more easily. Investing in a better reference genome will have big payoffs in other ways too, says Wonkam. The Human Genome Project spent $3.8 billion to build the existing reference.  That investment  has not only advanced genetic medicine, but has also led to advancements in studying infectious diseases, friendly microbes and other areas of biomedical research. Having a truly complete reference genome will be even more of a boon, Wonkam predicts. He estimates that the 10-year project to sequence the DNA of 3 million Africans will cost about $450 million a year. But \u201cwe\u2019re going to reap a singular benefit, globally, far beyond [the cost].\u201d "},

Noticing that curiosity, Doudna\u2019s father left James Watson\u2019s book  The Double Helix  on her bed one day. Doudna sped through the pages, absorbing how Watson and Francis Crick deciphered the structure of DNA. Today, she credits the book and her insatiable inquisitiveness for driving her to become a scientist and for setting the foundation for her to codiscover, nearly four decades later, a set of molecular scissors called CRISPR that can edit the genetic blueprint of life. Watson would later call CRISPR \u201cthe most important discovery since DNA\u2019s structure,\u201d Walter Isaacson writes in  The Code Breaker . The book, both a biography of Doudna and a deep dive into the ethics of genetic engineering, is written for people who may have heard of CRISPR but don\u2019t know much about the history of its development. The book digs into the fierce patent battles that have ensued between the University of California (Doudna is at the Berkeley campus) and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, where other researchers, most notably Feng Zhang, were also developing the gene-editing tool. The tone and style of the book\u2019s first half mimic  The Double Helix , setting up the scientific process as a detective story, one focused first on understanding how bacteria rely on CRISPR to fend off viral infections and then on how scientists transformed that natural bacterial defense system into a tool that allows humans to edit their own DNA. While  The Code Breaker  starts off as a page-turner, the latter half is more tedious, with tangents that loosely weave together the battle over the claim to discovering CRISPR and the ethical questions around using it. Those questions came to the fore in 2018, after the  birth of two babies whose genes had been edited  while still embryos ( SN: 11/27/18 ). Impressively timely, Isaacson bounces from concerns over \u201cdesigner\u201d children to  Doudna\u2019s shared 2020 Nobel Prize in chemistry  ( SN: 10/7/20 ) to her latest race against rivals: adapting CRISPR into a tool that can quickly  detect the virus that causes COVID-19 , or one that could potentially thwart the virus\u2019s infection of human cells ( SN: 8/31/20 ). No longer is the race for patents and prizes, Isaacson writes, but one to save humankind from the coronavirus and possibly other ills.  Buy  The Code Breaker  from Bookshop.org.

To move quickly, a breed of domesticated rabbit called sauteur d\u2019Alfort sends its back legs sky high and walks on its front paws. That strange gait may be the result of  a gene tied to limb movement , researchers report March 25 in  PLOS Genetics . Sauteur d\u2019Alfort rabbits aren\u2019t the only animal to adopt an odd scamper if there\u2019s a mutation to this gene, known as  RORB . Mice with a mutation to the gene also do handstands if they start to run, says Stephanie Koch, a neuroscientist at University College London who was not involved with the rabbit work. And even while walking, the mice  hike their back legs up to waddle forward , almost like a duck. \u201cI spent four years looking at these mice doing little handstands, and now I get to see a rabbit do the same handstand,\u201d says Koch, who led a 2017 study published in  Neuron  that explored  the mechanism behind the \u201cduck gait\u201d in mice . \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201d Understanding why the rabbits move in such a strange way could help researchers learn more about how the spinal cord works. The study is \u201ccontributing to our basic knowledge about a very important function in humans and all animals \u2014 how we are able to move,\u201d says Leif Andersson, a molecular geneticist at Uppsala University in Sweden. In the rabbit study, Andersson and colleagues bred hop-less sauteur d\u2019Alfort male rabbits with New Zealand white female rabbits that can hop. The team then scanned the genetic blueprints of the offspring that couldn\u2019t hop and looked for mutations that didn\u2019t appear in offspring that could. A mutation in the  RORB  gene popped up as a likely candidate for the rabbits\u2019 acrobatic handstands. That change creates faulty versions of the genetic instructions that cells use to make proteins, the researchers found. As a result, there appears to be less of the RORB protein in specialized nerve cells in rabbits that have the mutation compared with rabbits that don\u2019t. Those spinal cord nerve cells, called interneurons, help coordinate the left and right side of the body and are crucial for a normal gait, Andersson says. Without the RORB protein in interneurons, the rabbits may lack the ability to coordinate what their hind limbs are doing, which restricts their ability to hop. While moving slowly from place to place, rabbits with the defective gene can walk normally, alternating their front and hind legs. But rabbits hop to move fast or to travel over long distances. And hopping requires synchronized hind legs to jump at the same time, says study coauthor Miguel Carneiro, a molecular geneticist at Universidade do Porto in Vair\u00e3o, Portugal.  Without that coordination, some hop-less bunnies might do a more drastic handstand than others. But all rabbits with a  RORB  mutation use their front paws to move quickly, Carneiro says. It\u2019s an interesting observation, although the study doesn\u2019t reveal much about how the lack of the RORB protein in interneurons spurs the rabbits\u2019 handstands, Koch says. \u201cAll they\u2019re looking for is that mutation in one gene and how that gene is affecting the spinal cord, but it could be affecting everything in the rabbit. We have no idea.\u201d \u00a0 Uncovering how that genetic defect affects the body more broadly could be important for understanding the way all animals move. Even people can\u2019t run without harmonized movements of our four limbs. \u201cIf you look at the 100-meter sprint \u2014 Usain Bolt or someone like that \u2014 there\u2019s super coordination between limbs,\u201d Andersson says. \u201cIf you lack the coordination between arms and legs\u2026 you could never compete for a gold medal.\u201d These handstand rabbits wouldn\u2019t grab any golds either. But they could help researchers develop ways to repair the body when defects in  RORB  cause disease, Koch says. "},

Analyses of DNA found in human fossils from around that time \u2014 the oldest known human remains in Europe \u2014 suggest that interbreeding between  Homo sapiens  and Neandertals, who were on the fast track to extinction, occurred more commonly than has often been assumed, two new studies suggest. Genetic evidence in the new reports indicates for the first time that distinct human populations reached Europe shortly after 50,000 years ago. Neandertals interbred with all the groups detected so far, ensuring that some of their genes live on today in our DNA. Remains of three  H. sapiens  individuals unearthed in Bulgaria\u2019s Bacho Kiro Cave yielded  nuclear DNA containing Neandertal contributions of about 3 to 4 percent , evolutionary geneticist Mateja Hajdinjak of the Francis Crick Institute in London and colleagues report April 7 in  Nature . The ancient DNA came from a tooth and two bone fragments radiocarbon dated to between around 43,000 and 46,000 years ago. Stone tools typical of late Stone Age humans were found in the same sediment as the fossils. \u201cAll of the Bacho Kiro individuals had recent Neandertal ancestors, as few as five to seven generations back in their family trees,\u201d Hajdinjak says. Further evidence of ancient interbreeding comes from a nearly complete human skull discovered in 1950 in a cave in what\u2019s now the Czech Republic. About  2 percent of the genes  in DNA from that fossil, identified as a female\u2019s, also come from Neandertals, evolutionary geneticist Kay Pr\u00fcfer of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, and colleagues report April 7 in  Nature Ecology & Evolution . Analysis of those DNA segments suggests she also lived around 45,000 years ago. The  H. sapiens  fossils in Bulgaria and the Czech Republic aren\u2019t the first ones found with bits of Neandertal DNA in their genomes, but they are most likely the oldest. The long Neandertal DNA segments in the eastern European woman, which would have broken into shorter segments in later human generations, suggest she lived a few hundred to a few thousand years earlier than a previously reported 45,000-year-old Siberian man who  shared 2.3 percent of his genes with Neandertals  ( SN: 10/22/14 ). That find indicated that interbreeding outside of Europe dated to as early as 60,000 years ago. And a Romanian man who lived roughly 40,000 years ago also possessed long stretches of Neandertal DNA, indicating he was  four to six generations removed from a Neandertal relative  ( SN: 5/11/15 ). Neandertals went extinct around 40,000 years ago, though their genetic remnants remain \u2014 today, non-African people carry, on average, nearly 2 percent Neandertal DNA.  Present-day Africans possess a smaller Neandertal genetic legacy  ( SN: 1/30/20 ). Taken together, the new studies suggest that some early human entrants to Europe had a long-lasting impact on our DNA while others hit genetic dead-ends. Bacho Kiro humans represent a newly identified population of ancient Europeans with genetic ties to present-day East Asians and Native Americans, but not western Eurasians, Hajdinjak\u2019s group says. Like the ancient Romanian and Siberian men, the Czech Republic woman contributed no genes to  H. sapiens  that lived after around 40,000 years ago. \u201cIt is remarkable that the Bacho Kiro finds could represent a population that was spreading 45,000 years ago at least from Bulgaria to China,\u201d says evolutionary geneticist Carles Lalueza-Fox of the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, who did not participate in either new investigation. If  H. sapiens  and Neandertals regularly interbred as the latter population neared its demise, then relatively large numbers of incoming humans accumulated a surprising amount of DNA from smaller Neandertal populations, Lalueza-Fox suspects. After 40,000 years ago, additional migrations into Europe by people with little or no Neandertal ancestry would have further diluted Neandertal DNA from the human gene pool, he says. Those humans made distinctive stone and bone tools and served as ancestors of present-day Europeans, Hajdinjak suggests. At Bacho Kiro Cave, for instance, newly recovered DNA from a roughly 35,000-year-old  H. sapiens  bone fragment displays a different makeup than that of the cave\u2019s earlier human inhabitants. This individual contributed genes mainly to later populations in Europe and western Asia, Hajdinjak says. "},

Yuichi Yamazaki/Getty Images", "date": "April 14, 2021 at 10:08 am", "content": " ancient coronavirus, or a closely related pathogen, triggered an epidemic among ancestors of present-day East Asians roughly 25,000 years ago, a new study indicates. Analysis of DNA from more than 2,000 people shows that  genetic changes in response to that persistent epidemic  accumulated over the next 20,000 years or so, David Enard, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, reported April 8 at the  virtual annual meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists . The finding raises the possibility that some East Asians today have inherited biological adaptations to coronaviruses or closely related viruses. The discovery opens the way to exploring how genes linked to ancient viral epidemics may contribute to modern disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Genes with ancient viral histories might also provide clues to researchers searching for better antiviral drugs, although that remains to be demonstrated. Enard\u2019s group consulted  a publicly available DNA database  of 2,504 individuals from 26 ethnic populations on five continents, including Chinese Dai, Vietnamese Kinh and African Yoruba people. The team first focused on 420 proteins known to interact with coronaviruses, including 332 that interact with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. These interactions could range from boosting immune responses to making it easier for a virus to hijack a cell. Substantially increased production of all 420 proteins, a sign of past exposures to coronavirus-like epidemics, appeared only in East Asians. Enard\u2019s group traced the viral responses of 42 of those proteins back to roughly 25,000 years ago. An analysis of the genes known to orchestrate production of those proteins determined that specific variants became more common around 25,000 years ago before leveling off in frequency by around 5,000 years ago. That pattern is consistent with an initially vigorous genetic response to a virus that waned over time, either as East Asians adapted to the virus or as the virus lost its ability to cause disease, Enard said. Twenty-one of the 42 gene variants act either to enhance or deter the effects of a wide array of viruses, not just coronaviruses, suggesting that an unknown virus that happened to exploit similar proteins as coronaviruses could have instigated the ancient epidemic, Enard said. These findings \u201cshow that East Asians have been exposed to coronavirus-like epidemics for a long time and are more [genetically] adapted to epidemics of these viruses,\u201d says evolutionary geneticist Lluis Quintana-Murci of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, who was not involved in the new study. It\u2019s possible that DNA adjustments to coronavirus epidemics over many thousands of years may contribute to  lower COVID-19 infection and death rates reported in East Asian nations , versus European countries and the United States, Quintana-Murci speculates. But it\u2019s unknown at this point what, if any, effect those DNA tweaks could have. Many factors, including  jobs that can\u2019t be done remotely  and  lack of health care access , drive COVID-19 infections, he says (SN: 11/11/20; SN 7/2/20). And social factors, such as quick, strict lockdowns and widespread mask wearing, may have deterred infections in some East Asian nations. Large-scale genetic studies in modern East Asians and probes of ancient human DNA spanning the past 25,000 years are needed to explore how the 42 identified gene variants may contribute to COVID-19 or other coronavirus infections. Those variants may also present opportunities for developing COVID-19 treatments, Enard said. So far, though, only four of those genes are targets of 11 drugs being used or investigated in studies of COVID-19 treatments, he said. Enard\u2019s findings follow related evidence that  a set of inherited Neandertal gene variants  raise the risk of developing severe COVID-19 in some South Asians and Europeans, while others may provide  some level of protection  ( SN: 10/2/20; SN: 2/17/21 ).

Until now, the ancient human DNA analyzed from sediments came from mitochondria \u2014 the organelles that act as energy factories in our cells \u2014 not the chromosomes in cell nuclei, which contain the actual genetic instructions for building and regulating the body. Although chromosomes hold far more information, retrieving samples of this nuclear DNA from caves proved challenging because of its relative scarcity. A human cell often possesses thousands of copies of its mitochondrial genome for every one set of chromosomes, and the vast majority of any DNA found in ancient dirt belongs to other animals and to microbes. To extract ancient human chromosomal DNA from caves, Vernot and colleagues identified regions in chromosomes rich in mutations specific to hominids to help the team filter out nonhuman DNA. This helped the researchers successfully analyze Neandertal chromosomal DNA from more than 150 samples of sediment roughly 50,000 to 200,000 years old from a cave in Spain and two caves in Siberia. After the team compared its data with DNA previously collected from Neandertal fossils of about the same age, the findings suggested that all these Neandertals were split into two genetically distinct waves that both dispersed across Eurasia. One emerged about 135,000 years ago, while the other arose roughly 105,000 years ago, with one branch of the earlier wave giving rise to all the later groups examined. In the Spanish cave, the researchers found genetic evidence of both groups, with the later wave apparently replacing the earlier one. \u201cThere were signs based on the mitochondrial DNA of this turnover, but seeing it clearly with the nuclear DNA is really exciting,\u201d says paleogeneticist Qiaomei Fu at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing, who did not take part in this study. The later wave may be linked with the emergence of the last \u201cclassic\u201d stage of Neandertal anatomy, skeletal features such as  a bulge at the back of the skull  that may indicate strong neck muscles or enlarged brain regions linked to vision, the researchers say. This later wave may have coincided with cooling and other environmental changes that came with the advent of the last ice age, they note. This research emphasizes how scientists working at potential Neandertal sites should not throw away dirt as is traditionally done, says paleogeneticist Carles Lalueza-Fox at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, who did not take part in this study. Instead, he says, special protocols may be needed to avoid contaminating these areas with modern DNA. "},

More than 40 years ago, scientists in Russia reported that a type of bacteriophage called cyanophage S-2L replaces the DNA building block adenine, commonly known as A, with 2-aminoadenine, designated Z. But no one knew how the phage went from A to Z, or why. After decades of wondering, two independent groups of scientists have discovered how the  viruses make  and  build Z into their genetic instructions , and  one reason they do it , the teams report in three studies in the April 30  Science. The findings have implications for the origins of life on Earth, the search for life on other planets and  multiple potential applications  in biomedicine, synthetic biology, material sciences and computing, says Farren Isaacs, a molecular and synthetic biologist at Yale University who coauthored a commentary in the same issue of  Science . \u201cIt\u2019s a really fundamental discovery.\u201d In the 1990s, Philippe Marli\u00e8re, a xenobiologist then at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, was \u201clooking for examples divergent from life as we know it,\u201d when he came across the 1977 Russian study describing the cyanophage with the unusual DNA. After getting a sample of the virus, Marli\u00e8re and colleagues deciphered the phage\u2019s complete set of genetic instructions, or genome. In the virus\u2019s genome, the researchers found instructions for building an enzyme, called PurZ, that could carry out the first step in making Z \u2014 also known as diaminopurine. The Pasteur Institute filed a patent on the enzyme in Marli\u00e8re\u2019s name in 2003. With the enzyme in hand, \u201cit became crystal clear how Z was made, but we didn\u2019t [do] any experiments to prove that we were right,\u201d says Marli\u00e8re, now president of the European Syndicate of Synthetic Scientists and Industrialists in Berlin. The project was halted for a variety of reasons. The researchers didn\u2019t publish their findings until now, in part, because PurZ wasn\u2019t the enzyme Marli\u00e8re was looking for. Instead, he says he had hoped to find a different enzyme, a polymerase that would reject adenine and instead build DNA with Z in its place. \u201cI was very, very disappointed,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause the polymerase I was craving could not be detected in that phage.\u201d \u00a0 Indeed, this phage\u2019s polymerase isn\u2019t what he was looking for. Marli\u00e8re\u2019s collaborator Pierre Alexandre Kaminski and colleagues found that cyanophage S-2L\u2019s polymerase isn\u2019t picky about using A or Z. Instead, another viral  enzyme called DatZ degrades adenine building blocks , leaving the polymerase no choice but to use Z, Kaminski, a biochemist at the Pasteur Institute, and colleagues report April 23 in  Nature Communications . Periodically, Marli\u00e8re searched genetic databases for other phages that have PurZ and might contain the elusive picky polymerase. Then about four years ago, he says, \u201cI got results. Ding, ding, ding! And I didn\u2019t get just one. I got 12. And bingo, right next door to this PurZ gene was, guess what, a polymerase gene. Aha!\u201d The  Siphoviridae  bacteriophages that infect a wide variety of bacteria all have versions of the polymerase, called DpoZ, that preferentially insert Z instead of A into the viruses\u2019 DNA, the researchers report. Marli\u00e8re has filed a patent on the enzyme. The alternative alphabet may be used far more widely than previously thought, says Huimin Zhao, a synthetic biologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He first heard about the bacteriophage that use Z-containing DNA at a dinner party a few years ago, he recalls. Not knowing that the French scientists were still working on the puzzle, he also searched databases and found 60 bacteriophages that contain PurZ, including phages from both the  Siphoviridae  and  Podoviridae  families. His team also worked out the biochemical pathway the phages use to make and incorporate Z, and found enzymes that degrade A. Just because the phages have the enzymes, they don\u2019t necessarily use Z in their DNA. So Zhao and colleagues in China chose a phage called SH-Ab 15497 that infects  Acinetobacter  bacteria, and confirmed that its DNA alphabet also has Z in place of A, his team reports. Why phages would bother with the unconventional DNA was still unknown. One hypothesis is that replacing A with Z is a countermeasure against bacterial defense enzymes, known as restriction enzymes, that chop up DNA from invading phages. Such enzymes have a hard time recognizing and cutting DNA containing Z bases, Zhao and colleagues found. \u201cThe phage is trying to avoid being destroyed by the host,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is really a protection mechanism for the phage.\u201d It\u2019s also part of a never-ending arms race between phages and bacteria, says Steven Benner, a chemist and astrobiologist at the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution in Alachua, Fla. It\u2019s possible that other phages that use Z or other alternative DNA bases may still be out there. \u201cWe have overlooked this life-form on Earth because our molecular tools didn\u2019t allow us to look for it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat these guys have done is discover an entire biosphere that was missing from our inventory.\u201d It\u2019s debatable whether Z-containing phages are new forms of life (not to mention the ongoing debate about whether viruses are alive), says Floyd Romesberg, a synthetic biologist at the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology company Sanofi\u2019s site in La Jolla, Calif. But it does open up new possibilities, he says, for what life is, was, and could become. \u201cLife isn\u2019t exactly what we thought it was. Life doesn\u2019t have to be GTAC,\u201d he says, referring to the four letters of the standard DNA alphabet. \u201cWhat it says is that life can be more diverse.\u201d That realization could influence the  search for life on other planets  ( SN: 4/18/16 ). Scientists often assume that they should search for guanine, thymine, adenine and cytosine, the bases of DNA as we\u2019ve known it until now. But maybe researchers should be looking for 2-aminoadenine, the Z base, instead, Benner says. After all, Z forms three hydrogen bonds with thymine, instead of the two hydrogen bonds that hold A\u2013T base pairs together. That makes Z\u2013T paired DNA more stable and potentially able to stand up to hotter or harsher conditions than conventional DNA can, he says. With the extra stability, one might wonder why all organisms on Earth don\u2019t use Z. Stability isn\u2019t everything, Romesberg says. DNA has to be unwound and split apart to be copied. That may be harder to do with Z\u2013T base pairs. Z also changes how DNA curves and bends, perhaps making it harder to pack into tight spaces the way A-containing genetic material can. That might make A more attractive for other organisms. Or perhaps it was just an accident that A came first. Once cells started using that base, too many things would have to change to completely switch to another base, says Romesberg, who has been working for years to get bacteria to  incorporate exotic DNA bases  ( SN: 5/7/14 ). Cells have a hard time swapping because there are so many different parts that would have to be changed to accommodate a new DNA base. Viruses\u2019 stripped-down genomes are more flexible, Romesberg says: They carry around less machinery because they make the host do most of the work. Even the Z-phage do just the first step in making Z\u00a0and rely on several host enzymes to finish the recipe. It\u2019s still not known whether cellular organisms can write Z into their DNA, too.

Cleaning up that biological wreckage comes at a big price. These invaders, often thrust into new environments unintentionally (or intentionally, to combat pests) by humans, can transmit new diseases, devastate crops and eat away at crucial infrastructure. From 1970 to 2017, such invasions  cost the global economy at least $1.28 trillion  in damages and in efforts to control them, researchers report March 31 in  Nature . As the globe becomes increasingly interconnected and invasive species take over new habitats, that cost grows. \u201cFor decades, researchers have been evaluating the significant impacts of invasive species, but the problem isn\u2019t well known by the public and policy makers,\u201d says Boris Leroy, a biogeographer at the French National Museum of Natural History in Paris. \u201cBy estimating the global cost, we hoped to raise awareness of the issue and identify the most costly species.\u201d Leroy and his colleagues screened over 19,000 published papers, ultimately analyzing nearly 1,900 that detailed the costs of various invasions at particular times. The team then constructed a statistical model that estimated yearly costs, adjusting for factors like inflation, different currencies and timescales. Between 1970 and 2017, annual costs roughly doubled every six years, reaching a yearly bill of $162.7 billion in 2017. Intensified global trade over that period gave invaders more opportunities to hitch rides on cargo ships or airplanes, the researchers say. And deforestation and agricultural expansion probably sped their spread by allowing easier access to pristine areas. On the whole, cleaning up the damage caused by invasive species cost $892 billion, about 13 times higher than the $66 billion spent managing invasions, the researchers found. \u201cThis is a really ambitious effort,\u201d says Helen Roy, an ecologist at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Wallingford, England. \u201cThere are major gaps in the data, which the authors are extremely transparent about,\u201d she says. The analysis was heavily weighted towards North America, Europe and parts of Asia and Oceania. Agricultural pests, like insects, tended to be overrepresented in published literature compared with invasive plants. \u201cStill, getting a global look is very important,\u201d Roy says. While this number is almost certainly an underestimate, she says, the study \u201cshows us that this is a massive problem that\u2019s getting worse.\u201d Investing more in cargo inspections and other biosecurity measures or monitoring could help minimize these costs with comparatively small spending increases. \u201cIt\u2019s much cheaper than waiting for the species to establish and spread widely before responding,\u201d she says. Here\u2019s a closer look at the top five costliest invasive species. The Asian tiger mosquito ( A. albopictus ) arrived in the United States in the mid-1980s, by way of hitchhiking in used tires shipped from its native Asia. First detected in Houston, it rapidly spread to 40 states. It\u2019s also invaded parts of Europe, South America, Africa and Australia.\u00a0 A. aegypti , or the yellow fever mosquito, is native to sub-Saharan Africa and spread around the world by similar methods. Together, these two mosquitoes cause significant damage to public health by transmitting a range of diseases like Zika, chikungunya, yellow fever and dengue, which accounts for the bulk of their cost. As the mosquitoes spread, the  toll of these diseases grows  ( SN:  11/20/19 ). These rodents\u2019 worldwide occupation stems from about 3,000 years of hitchhiking on human boats. Once they arrive in a new location, rats often outcompete other small mammals, but can also harm birds and aquatic species. On islands around the world, rats have driven many species to extinction. For example, the Pacific rat, native to mainland southeast Asia, has snuffed out at least 1,000 species of island birds. Rats\u2019 high cost stems from these biodiversity losses, but the rodents also can damage crops, destroy property and transmit disease (like the bubonic plague).\u00a0 Native to Europe and the Middle East, our feline friends have established themselves on all nonfrozen continents. Cats are excellent predators, and can make a quick meal from a variety of prey, from insects to birds. By some estimates,  cats kill a billion birds each year  in the United States alone ( SN:  1/29/13 ). The bulk of the economic damage inflicted by cats cataloged in Leroy\u2019s analysis comes from their impact on native biodiversity and resulting losses in spending on birdwatching and hunting birds like ducks, pheasants and grouse.\u00a0 These subterranean termites native to East Asia have spread around the globe via trade. Termites can thrive wherever there is cellulose (like wood) and moisture, which has helped them quickly establish colonies upon being introduced to a new region. Their appetite for wood can wreak havoc on all kinds of structures, from homes to bridges. While they can also damage crops and tree farms, their high cost in this analysis boils down to their impact on infrastructure. Fire ants usually become the dominant ant species when introduced to a new region, due to their aggressive foraging tactics, which include potent stings and bites. Native to South America, these ants arrived in the United States in the 1930s by boat, most likely carried in soil from the region. They\u2019ve also spread to Australia, New Zealand, China and around the Caribbean. Fire ant colonies have wide-ranging impacts; they can feed on a variety of seedlings, from citrus to soybeans, reduce the size of grazing lands for livestock and bite and sting farm animals and humans.

A genetic analysis of the most widespread reef coral in the Indo-Pacific revealed that rather than being a single species ( Pachyseris speciosa) , it was actually  four distinct species  of coral, researchers report April 2 in  Current Biology . Coral reefs are the condominiums of ocean biodiversity, supporting more species per square meter than any other marine habitat. Understanding which coral species foster that biodiversity and how those corals behave is vital to taking care of them, especially as a warming climate  threatens overall ocean biodiversity  ( SN: 5/6/20 ). \u201cJust knowing what\u2019s there is critical to tracking what we are losing,\u201d says Rebecca Vega-Thurber, a marine microbiologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis, who was not involved in the new study. The results suggest other corals thought to be a single species may actually be much more diverse than researchers realized. Using a combination of scuba gear and remotely operated vehicles, marine biologist Pim Bongaerts of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco and colleagues sampled more than 1,400  P. speciosa  corals from the ocean surface down to 80 meters. In the lab, the sampleslooked identical, and their internal structures were indistinguishable in scanning electron microscope images. Yet, their genomes \u2014 their full genetic instruction books \u2014 revealed the corals had diverged millions of years ago. That made sense for one of the species in the Red Sea\u2019s Gulf of Aqaba, which was geographically separated from the others. But the other three newly identified species lived together on the same reefs in the waters off South Asia. If the corals were living together, why didn\u2019t one overtake the other two, the team wondered. Examining habitat data from their dives, the researchers found the three distinct coral species favored different water depths, with one abundant in the top 10 meters and the other two flourishing deeper down. The three coral species also had different concentrations of photosynthetic algae and pigments, suggesting they had distinct strategies for hosting their algae partners that provide food. And spawning times of these three species were slightly spread out too. One released most of its gametes five days after the full moon, another seven days after, and the third at nine days and counting. The separation of spawning could help the eggs and sperm of each species hook up with its correct species match. This study is the first to show how a set of cryptic reef corals are splitting up their shared ecological space \u2014 by depth, physiology and spawning time, Bongaerts says. \u201cThere are all these cryptic lineages occurring, but they\u2019ve largely been ignored from an ecological point of view.\u201d The results open the door to the possibility that many other doppelg\u00e4nger corals may be multiple species that coexist thanks to ecological differences, says reef genomicist Christian Voolstra at the University of Konstanz in Germany. \u201cThere is a minimal chance that they picked the unicorn, but I highly doubt it. This paper shows that in all likelihood there is a huge diversity of reef corals with distinct ecologies.\u201d "},

Lions, hyenas and other top predators still stalk herds of wildebeests over a million strong, preventing them from eating too much vegetation. This diversity of trees and grasses support scores of other species, from vivid green-orange Fischer\u2019s lovebirds to dung beetles. In turn, such species carry seeds or pollen across the plains, enabling plant reproduction. Humans are there too, but in relatively low densities. Overall, it\u2019s a prime example of what biologists call an ecologically intact ecosystem: a bustling tangle of complex relationships that together sustain a rich diversity of life, undiminished by us. Such places are vanishingly rare. The vast majority of land on Earth \u2014 a staggering 97 percent \u2014  no longer qualifies as ecologically intact , according to a sweeping survey of Earth\u2019s ecosystems. Over the last 500 years, too many species have been lost, or their numbers reduced, researchers report April 15 in  Frontiers in Forests and Global Change . Of the few fully intact ecosystems, only about 11 percent fall within existing protected areas, the researchers found. Much of this pristine habitat exists in northern latitudes, in Canada\u2019s boreal forests or Greenland\u2019s tundra, which aren\u2019t bursting with biodiversity. But chunks of the species-rich rainforests of the Amazon, Congo and Indonesia also remain intact. \u201cThese are the best of the best, the last places on Earth that haven\u2019t lost a single species that we know of,\u201d says Oscar Venter, a conservation scientist at the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Identifying such places is crucial, he says, especially for regions under threat of development that require protection, like the Amazon rainforest. Conservation scientists have long tried to map how much of the planet remains undegraded by human activity. Previous estimates using satellite imagery or raw demographic data found anywhere from 20 to 40 percent of the globe was free from obvious human incursions, such as roads, light pollution or the gaping scars of deforestation. But an intact forest canopy can hide an emptied-out ecosystem below. \u201cHunting, the impacts of invasive species, climate change \u2014 these can harm ecosystems, but they can\u2019t be easily sensed via satellite,\u201d says conservation biologist Andrew Plumptre of the University of Cambridge. A Serengeti with fewer lions or hyenas \u2014 or none at all \u2014 may look intact from space, but it\u2019s missing key species that help the whole ecosystem run. What exactly constitutes a fully intact and functioning ecosystem is fuzzy and debated by ecologists, but Plumptre and his colleagues started by looking for habitats that retained their full retinue of species, at their natural abundance as of A.D. 1500. That\u2019s the baseline the International Union for the Conservation of Nature uses to assess species extinctions, even though humans have been  altering ecosystems by wiping out big mammals  for thousands of years ( SN: 8/26/15 ). Large swaths of land are necessary to support wide-ranging species. So the researchers initially considered only areas larger than 10,000 square kilometers, roughly the size of Puerto Rico. The team combined existing datasets on habitat intactness with three different assessments of where species have been lost, encompassing about 7,500 animal species. While 28.4 percent of land areas larger than 10,000 square kilometers is relatively free from human disturbance, only 2.9 percent holds all the species it did 500 years ago. Shrinking the minimum size of the area included to 1,000 square kilometers bumps the percentage up, but barely, to 3.4. Simply retaining species isn\u2019t enough for ecological intactness, since diminished numbers of key players could throw the system out of whack. The researchers tallied up the population densities of just over a dozen large mammals whose collective ranges span much of the globe, including gorillas, bears and lions. This is a narrow look, Plumptre concedes, but large mammals play important ecological roles. They also have the best historical data and are also often the first to be affected by human incursion. Factoring in declines in large mammals only slightly decreased the percentage of ecologically intact land, down to 2.8 percent. Overall the tally of ecologically intact land \u201cwas much lower than we were expecting,\u201d says Plumptre. \u201cGoing in, I\u2019d guessed that it would be 8 to 10 percent. It just shows how huge an impact we\u2019ve had.\u201d Both Venter and Jedediah Brodie, a conservation ecologist at the University of Montana in Missoula, question whether the authors were too strict in their definition of ecological intactness. \u201cMany ecosystems around the world have lost one or two species but are still vibrant, diverse communities,\u201d Brodie says. A decline in a few species may not spell disaster for the whole ecosystem, since other species may swoop in to fill those roles. Still, the study is a valuable first look that shows us \u201cwhere the world looks like it did 500 years ago and gives us something to aim for,\u201d Plumptre says. It also identifies areas ripe for restoration. While only 3 percent of land is currently ecologically intact, the introduction of up to five lost species could restore 20 percent of land to its former glory, the researchers calculate.\u00a0 Species reintroductions have worked well in places like Yellowstone National Park, where the  restoration of wolves  has put the ecosystem back into balance ( SN: 7/21/20 ). Such schemes may not work everywhere. But as the global community discusses  how to protect nature over the next decade  ( SN: 4/22/20 ), Plumptre hopes this study will prompt policy makers to \u201cnot just protect the land that\u2019s there, but also think about restoring it to what it could be.\u201d "},

In the American Southwest, wild donkeys and horses often dig into the dusty sediment to reach cool, crystal clear groundwater to quench their thirst. New research shows this equid ingenuity has far reaching benefits for the ecosystem. Equid wells can act as desert oases,  providing a major source of water during dry times  that benefits a whole host of desert animals and keystone trees, researchers report in the April 30  Science . Introduced to North America in the last 500 years or so, wild donkeys and horses are often cast as villains in the West. These species can trample native vegetation, erode creek beds and outcompete native animals. But when Erick Lundgren, a field ecologist at Aarhus University in Denmark, first observed wild donkeys digging wells in 2014, he wondered whether these holes might benefit ecosystems, similar to the way elephant-built water holes can sustain a community in the African savanna. \u201cBecause of the way we value [feral] horses and donkeys, the orthodoxy tends to focus on how they harm ecosystems,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wanted to see whether these holes provided a resource when water is scarce.\u201d\u00a0 First, Lundgren and his colleagues had to see whether these holes actually increase accessible water. Over the course of three summers from 2015 to 2018, they mapped out the surface area of water in wells and groundwater-fed streams at four sites in Arizona\u2019s Sonoran Desert.\u00a0 Water availability was highly variable among sites, but equid wells generally increased accessible water, especially as temperatures rose. At one site, wells were the only source of drinking water once the stream completely dried up. Elsewhere, wells provided up to 74 percent of available surface water. Wells also decreased the distance between water sources by an average of 843 meters, making this essential resource more accessible and easing tensions that can escalate among drinkers at isolated water holes, Lundgren says. Once wells were dug, other animals came. In droves. Researchers set up cameras at five sites in the Sonoran and Mojave deserts, staking out wells, riverbanks and dry spots. They documented 57 vertebrate species, from migratory songbirds to mountain lions, slurping at the wells, which is about equal to the number of species seen at streams and 64 percent higher than dry spots. \u201cWe even caught a black bear drinking from a well,\u201d says Lundgren, who also takes swigs from the wells from time to time. \u201cThe water is quite cool, and cleaner than other sources.\u201d Wells can also be nurseries for cottonwood seedlings that require moist, open areas to grow. These fast-growing seedlings struggle to break through the vegetation-stuffed riverbanks, and instead rely on floods for their first sips of water. But at one site, researchers found seedlings thriving in equid holes. Many survived the summer, growing as tall as 2 meters. In areas where dams reduce flooding, equid wells could be fulfilling an important ecosystem service for these iconic tree species, the researchers say. The study \u201cclearly shows that equids can alter these ecosystems in ways that can benefit other species,\u201d says Clive Jones, an ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y., who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. Such hydrological engineering isn\u2019t unheard of \u2014 beavers, for example, have an  outsized ability to engineer ecosystems  ( SN: 11/28/18) . Whether equid wells play a similarly crucial role remains to be seen, Jones says. \u201cMore data is needed to say exactly how important wells are in terms of the functioning of these ecosystems.\u201d Though the benefits of wells are clear in this study, it\u2019s too early to conclude that feral donkeys and horses are good for ecosystems, notes Jeffrey Beck, a restoration ecologist at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole body of research documenting the detrimental effects these animals can have on drylands around the world,\u201d Beck says. In Wyoming\u2019s Red Desert, for instance, he\u2019s studied how wild horses often drive antelope-like pronghorn from watering holes. Additionally, \u201cthe benefits [the equids] demonstrate in this study might be limited to this area,\u201d he says, since surface water in other areas may not be as accessible by digging. Still, the researchers hope this study can chip away at the notion that introduced species are wholly bad for ecosystems. In some areas, feral equids \u201care being killed by the hundreds of thousands in the name of purifying nature,\u201d says study author Arian Wallach, an ecologist at the University of Technology, Sydney.\u00a0To her, this study shows \u201cdonkeys [and horses] are part of nature too,\u201d and that eradication efforts might ripple throughout an ecosystem in unforeseen and unfortunate ways.

The microbes residing in a female mouse\u2019s gut  help shape the wiring of her offspring\u2019s brain , researchers report September 23 in  Nature.  While mouse and human development are worlds apart, the study hints at how a mother\u2019s microbiome may have long-term consequences for her offspring. Scientists have previously found links between a mouse mother\u2019s microbiome and her young\u2019s brain and behavior, but many of those studies worked with  animals that were stressed  ( SN: 7/9/18 ) or sick. Instead, Helen Vuong, a neurobiologist at UCLA, and her colleagues looked at what a mother\u2019s microbial mix normally does for her pups\u2019 brains. The new results point to the influence of specific microbes and the small molecules they produce, called metabolites. \u201cMetabolites from the microbiome of the mother can influence the developing brain of the fetus,\u201d says Cathryn Nagler, an immunologist at the University of Chicago who was not involved with the study. The metabolites do this by reaching a developing pup\u2019s brain where they affect the growth of axons, she says. Axons are the threadlike signal-transmitters of nerve cells. Vuong and her team looked at the brains of fetuses from pregnant mice \u2014 some with their usual gut bugs, some raised without microbes and others ridded of their gut bacteria with antibiotics. When a mother\u2019s microbes were missing, fetuses had shorter and fewer axons extending from the brain\u2019s \u201crelay station\u201d to the cortex, Vuong says. These connections are important for processing sensory information. Those brain differences appear to have consequences for mice later in life. As adults, mice born to microbe-deficient mothers were less sensitive to touch than mice from mothers with a typical microbiome. For instance, in one of several sensory tests, mice from microbe-deficient mothers took longer to notice a small piece of tape stuck to one of their paws. But when microbe-lacking females were given  Clostridia  bacteria, their offspring\u2019s brain and behavior developed normally.  Clostridia  are common gut microbes in humans and in mice, Nagler says, and their absence has been linked to some noncommunicable conditions,  such as food allergies  ( SN: 8/26/14 ). Small molecules made by the gut bugs may account for this effect. The researchers found that levels of several metabolites in mom\u2019s blood were linked to levels in the fetal blood and brain. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of cool that it\u2019s crossing different sites from the mom all the way to the fetus,\u201d Vuong says. That suggests mom shares her gut metabolites with her young. When pregnant mice with altered microbiomes received supplements of some of those metabolites, their pups\u2019 behavior developed normally. It\u2019s not clear yet how gut microbes and metabolites could be involved in human brain development. Still, this \u201cpoints now to a way that one might think about intervening,\u201d if pregnant women have deficient microbiomes, says Nagler, who is president of ClostraBio, a company that\u2019s exploring metabolite treatments for diseases related to the\u00a0immune system. Instead of trying to alter those microbiomes, which can be difficult, pregnant women could receive the needed metabolites directly. \u201cIt will be really important to understand whether these negative effects also happen in humans and whether they lead to long-term medical concerns,\u201d says Carolina Tropini, a microbiologist and biomedical engineer at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who was not part of the work. Researchers will need to study how the short-term benefits of antibiotics stack up against potential risks, she says, but such research may also lead to therapies for pregnant women who need antibiotics.

During Africa\u2019s dry season, when mosquitoes are scarce, malaria parasites have a hard time spreading to new hosts. So the parasites hide out in the human body by  keeping the cells they infect  from clinging to blood vessels, researchers report October 26 in  Nature Medicine.  This way, infected cells get removed from circulation and parasite levels in the body remain low, making people less sick and allowing the parasite to persist undetected.\u00a0 Doctors have long observed that symptoms of malaria, a deadly mosquito-borne infection, tend to wane during the dry season, which runs from January to May. But the reason has been unclear. Keeping a low profile during dry months is a successful strategy for the parasite, says Martin Rono, a parasitologist at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust in Kilifi, Kenya, who was not involved in the work. Knowing how malaria parasites persist without causing disease, until mosquitoes return to ferry the organisms from an infected person to the next victim, could help efforts to control malaria during the dry season. Plasmodium falciparum , the parasite responsible for malaria, infects red blood cells as part of a complex life cycle. Once inside a cell, the parasite produces proteins that dock on the cell\u2019s exterior and make it stick to blood vessels so that it won\u2019t be carried to the spleen, where it would otherwise get removed from the body. Typically, only the early life stages of the parasite circulate in the blood, while older parasites thrive inside red blood cells adhered to blood vessels, says Silvia Portugal, a biologist who led the work while at Heidelberg University Hospital in Germany. \u201cThat\u2019s textbook, so it was very surprising\u201d to see that dry-season parasites behaved differently in the lab, she says\u2014the cells weren\u2019t sticking. Portugal, now at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin, and her colleagues identified around 600 people in Mali infected with malaria in 2017 and 2018. First, the team ruled out two other ideas to explain the parasite\u2019s seasonality: genetic diversity and immunity. Genetically distinct parasites did not hit at different seasons, nor did the host immune system suppress the parasite\u2019s growth, the team found. But when the researchers compared which genes were turned on or off in samples taken from asymptomatic people in the dry season and symptomatic people in the wet season, they saw that 1,607 genes had distinct seasonal patterns. In the dry season, 1,131 genes were turned on that were off in wet-season parasites. Another 476 were turned off in dry-season parasites, suggesting that when the wet season ends,  P. falciparum  may alter its genetics to make red blood cells less sticky. That allows the parasite to replicate and persist without setting off alarm bells that alert the immune system to fight the infection. Blood cells infected with malaria use certain proteins to adhere to blood vessels almost like Velcro, Portugal says. The loss of stickiness could be because the parasite makes fewer of these proteins, or because the proteins are different in some way. It\u2019s still unclear, however, which specific genes are involved in the shift. One issue is that the researchers compared parasites from two different life stages, says Abdirahman Abdi, a parasitologist also at the KEMRI-Wellcome Trust. To narrow down which genes may be affecting stickiness, he says, the researchers may need to compare genetic activity in parasites at the same stage. "},

Bacteria that are potentially deadly to the bloodsuckers live on human skin. But a gene from bacteria that ticks incorporated into their genetic code around 40 million years ago helps protect the arachnids from those would-be microbial killers, a new study finds. That gene makes a protein, called Dae2, that black-legged ticks ( Ixodes scapularis\u00ad ) can use to  fend off microbial threats , researchers report December 10 in  Cell . But it\u2019s not an equal opportunity weapon. In a test tube, the protein doesn\u2019t mess with bacteria that don\u2019t bother the ticks, including  Borrelia burgdorferi , the bacterial cause of Lyme disease. The finding may explain how ticks can get past humans\u2019 defenses to transmit disease through their bite, including Lyme disease, the most  common tick-borne disease  in North America ( SN: 6/23/16 ). The arachnids\u2019 saliva harbors many bacteria-killing proteins. But few studies have analyzed how such proteins allow ticks to defend themselves from some microbes while retaining species that aren\u2019t dangerous to the ticks, says Albert Mulenga, a vector biologist at Texas A&M University in College Station who was not involved in the study. Such studies could help scientists pinpoint the proteins crucial for tick feeding as well as disease transmission. Researchers may then be able to develop ways to interfere with these proteins, stopping ticks from spreading disease. Bacteria today use their version of Dae2 to attack and kill other bacteria competing for nutrients by targeting and degrading a component of the cell wall. Without that component, rival bacterial cells break down and die. But it was unclear how black-legged ticks use their version of Dae2, which is found in tick saliva and guts. The biggest question was which bacteria does the ticks\u2019 Dae2 target, says Seemay Chou, a microbiologist and biochemist at the University of California, San Francisco. Chou and colleagues predicted that Dae2 might help black-legged ticks control the growth of  B. burgdorferi . Previous work had shown that ticks without Dae2  carried more of the Lyme disease microbe  than ticks with Dae2 when the arachnids fed on mice infected with the microbe. But repeated experiments found that the protein failed to kill the bacteria in a test tube, suggesting that the team\u2019s hypothesis was wrong. \u201cWe wanted that to be true so bad that we were missing the red lights telling us that can\u2019t be the case,\u201d says Beth Hayes, a microbiologist in Chou\u2019s lab. When Chou, Hayes and colleagues finally began testing the protein against other types of bacteria, the ticks\u2019 Dae2 turned out to be surprisingly effective. In a test tube, Dae2 killed  Bacillus subtilis , a common bacterial species found in soil, as well as human skin-dwelling species like  Staphylococcus epidermidis  and  Corynebacterium propinquum . Those bacteria don\u2019t typically cause disease in people. But they could be bad news for ticks, the researchers concluded. When ticks that were prevented from making Dae2 or had its activity blocked fed on mice, the arachnids tended to have higher levels of  Staphylococcus  bacteria than ticks with active Dae2. And when the researchers infected ticks lacking Dae2 with  S. epidermidis,  fewer than 40 percent survived longer than a day. Most infected ticks that had Dae2, however, survived as long as uninfected ticks. Looking back, \u201cit doesn\u2019t really make sense to look at the things that are surviving and thriving in ticks,\u201d Chou says. \u201cThe Lyme pathogen is clearly in a harmonious partnership with the tick, so if the tick immune system evolved to target anything, it\u2019s all the things that aren\u2019t there.\u201d It\u2019s still unclear what might happen to ticks that encounter  Staphylococcus  bacteria in nature. \u201cWe really don\u2019t know how much bacteria are in the bloodmeal while [ticks] are feeding,\u201d Mulenga says. It\u2019s possible that the arachnids may be exposed to levels that are nonlethal but might have other negative effects, such as preventing ticks from progressing through their life cycle.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Still, the findings emphasize that ticks are \u201creally elegant bloodsucking machines,\u201d and highlight that the word \u201cpathogen\u201d is just a status, dependent on who the host is, Chou says. As ticks feed on blood, there is a \u201cmirror situation where the ticks [carry] the Lyme pathogen, which is super bad for us, and our skin microbes are super bad for the ticks,\u201d she says. "},

Called a  Pauli crystal ,\nthe configuration is the result of a quantum mechanical rule called the Pauli\nexclusion principle. Scientists had previously predicted the\nexistence of Pauli crystals, but no one had observed them until now. \u201cIt just teaches\nus how beautiful physics is,\u201d says quantum physicist Tilman Esslinger of ETH Zurich.\nThe experiment reveals there are still new phenomena to be observed from a\nfoundational principle taught in introductory physics classes. \u201cIf I wrote a\ntextbook,\u201d Esslinger says, \u201cI would put that [experiment] in.\u201d Although the Pauli crystals themselves are\nbased on known physics, the technique used to observe them could help\nscientists better understand certain mysterious states of matter, such as superconductors,\nmaterials that conduct electricity without resistance, or superfluids, which\nflow without friction. Discovered by Austrian physicist\nWolfgang Pauli in 1925, the  Pauli exclusion principle  forbids electrons within an atom from acquiring\nmatching sets of quantum properties, such as energy and angular momentum ( SN: 4/10/99 ). Physicists soon realized\nthat the rule governs not only electrons but an entire class of particles\ncalled fermions, which in addition to electrons includes protons, neutrons and\nmany types of atoms. As a result, fermions can repel one another without directly\ninteracting. Whereas typical crystals form their regular arrangements thanks to\nelectromagnetic interactions, a Pauli crystal forms only due to this repulsion.\n \u201cIt\u2019s the most simple state of matter\nthat you can imagine,\u201d says Selim Jochim of Heidelberg University in Germany. Jochim and colleagues created their\nPauli crystal out of lithium atoms, corralled by lasers into a two-dimensional\nregion about a micrometer in radius. The researchers put groups of three or six\natoms in that trap at a time. The atoms were too close together to directly\nimage their positions to reveal any crystal-like structure. Instead, the team measured\nthe atoms\u2019 momenta by watching where the particles traveled when released. After\nthe experiment was repeated many times, the researchers found correlations, or\npatterns, in the atoms\u2019 momenta.  Because position and momentum are\nclosely related properties for these trapped particles, the relationship\nbetween the momenta also means that the atoms formed a regular spatial\nconfiguration akin to a crystal. Different flower-shaped configurations of the\nparticles\u2019 momenta arose depending on the number of particles in the trap. \u201cYou can really see this pattern,\u201d says Magdalena Za\u0142uska-Kotur of the Institute of Physics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, part of a team of physicists that had  previously predicted  that such structures could be observed in this type of experiment.

That weightlessness makes it easier to\nstudy a weird quantum state of matter known as a Bose-Einstein condensate. Now,\n the first Bose-Einstein condensates made on the space\nstation  are reported in the June 11  Nature. The ability to study the strange state\nof matter in orbit will aid scientists\u2019 understanding of fundamental physics as\nwell as make possible new, more sensitive quantum measurements, says Lisa\nW\u00f6rner of the German Aerospace Center Institute of Quantum Technologies in\nBremen. \u201cI cannot overstate the importance of this experiment to the\ncommunity,\u201d she says. A Bose-Einstein condensate occurs when\ncertain types of atoms are cooled to such low temperatures that they take on\none unified state. \u201cIt\u2019s as though they\u2019re joining arms and behaving as one\nharmonious object,\u201d says physicist David Aveline of NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory in Pasadena, Calif. To produce\nthe weird state of matter in orbit, he and colleagues created the Cold Atom Lab,\nwhich was installed on the space station in 2018. In orbit, the atoms are in free fall,\ncontinuously plummeting under the force of gravity, producing a weightlessness\nlike that felt by riders when a roller coaster suddenly drops. Those\nconditions, known as microgravity, make the space station an ideal environment\nfor studying Bose-Einstein condensates. To make a Bose-Einstein condensate,\natoms must be cooled while trapped with magnetic fields. On Earth, the trap\nmust be strong enough to prop the atoms up against gravity. Because that\u2019s not\na concern in microgravity, the trap can be weakened, allowing the cloud of\natoms to expand and cool. This process allows the condensate to achieve lower\ntemperatures than are possible with the same methods on Earth. In the Cold Atom\nLab, rubidium atoms reached tenths of billionths of kelvins.  Bose-Einstein condensates are already\nthe record holders for the  lowest known temperatures  ( SN: 4/13/15 ).\nWith further improvement to the cooling techniques, scientists expect that the\nCold Atom Lab could go even colder, to temperatures below any known in the\nuniverse. Another boon of microgravity is that\nmeasurements of the bizarre matter can be made for longer periods of time.\nNormally, atoms are released from the trap and then imaged quickly before\ngravity pulls them out of view. But in microgravity, researchers found that\nthey could observe the released atoms for as long as 1.1 seconds. On Earth, the\nsame techniques yield observation times of about 40 milliseconds. Those longer observation times could\nallow for more sensitive measurements. The atoms could be used to detect forces,\nincluding how Earth\u2019s gravity varies over time and across different parts of\nthe planet. Future experiments on dedicated satellites could make new, more\nsensitive measurements of phenomena such as sea level rise.  And the quantum matter could also be\nused to test fundamental principles of physics, such as  Einstein\u2019s equivalence principle  ( SN: 12/4/17 ).\nThat\u2019s the idea that objects of different masses or compositions \u2014 or in this\ncase, different types of atoms \u2014 will fall due to gravity at the same rate. Previous experiments have studied\nBose-Einstein condensates on a rocket shot into space that quickly fell back to\nEarth and in a tower that launched an apparatus upward and let it fall back\ndown. But the short duration of such flights limits how many experiments can be\nperformed.  \u201cThis is of course the big advantage\u201d of the space station, says physicist Maike Lachmann of Leibniz University Hannover in Germany, who coauthored a perspective article that appears in the same issue of  Nature . With about two years already logged on the space station, the Cold Atom Lab has already had plenty of time for experiments. \u201cThey can do very, very exciting things,\u201d Lachmann says. "},

Current versions are relatively wimpy, but with improvements, quantum computers have the potential to search enormous databases at lightning speed, or quickly factor huge numbers that would take a normal computer longer than the age of the universe. The machines could calculate the properties of intricate molecules or unlock the secrets of complicated chemical reactions. That kind of power could speed up the discovery of lifesaving drugs or help slash energy requirements for intensive industrial processes such as fertilizer production.  But there\u2019s a catch: Unlike today\u2019s reliable conventional computers, quantum computers must grapple with major error woes. And the quantum calculations scientists envision are complex enough to be impossible to redo by hand, as Johnson did for Glenn\u2019s ambitious flight.  If errors aren\u2019t brought under control, scientists\u2019 high hopes for quantum computers could come crashing down to Earth. Conventional computers \u2014 which physicists call classical computers to distinguish them from the quantum variety \u2014 are resistant to errors. In a classical hard drive, for example, the data are stored in bits, 0s or 1s that are represented by magnetized regions consisting of many atoms. That large group of atoms offers a built-in redundancy that makes classical bits resilient. Jostling one of the bit\u2019s atoms won\u2019t change the overall magnetization of the bit and its corresponding value of 0 or 1.  But quantum bits \u2014 or qubits \u2014 are inherently fragile. They are made from sensitive substances such as individual atoms, electrons trapped within tiny chunks of silicon called quantum dots, or small bits of superconducting material, which conducts electricity without resistance. Errors can creep in as qubits interact with their environment, potentially including electromagnetic fields, heat or stray atoms or molecules. If a single atom that represents a qubit gets jostled, the information the qubit was storing is lost.  Additionally, each step of a calculation has a significant chance of introducing error. As a result, for complex calculations, \u201cthe output will be garbage,\u201d says quantum physicist Barbara Terhal of the research center QuTech in Delft, Netherlands.  Before quantum computers can reach their much-hyped potential, scientists will need to master new tactics for fixing errors, an area of research called quantum error correction. The idea behind many of these schemes is to combine multiple error-prone qubits to form one more reliable qubit. The technique battles what seems to be a natural tendency of the universe \u2014 quantum things eventually lose their quantumness through interactions with their surroundings, a relentless process known as decoherence.  \u201cIt\u2019s like fighting erosion,\u201d says Ken Brown, a quantum engineer at Duke University. But quantum error correction provides a way to control the seemingly uncontrollable. Quantum computers gain their power from the special rules that govern qubits. Unlike classical bits, which have a value of either 0 or 1, qubits can take on an intermediate state called a superposition, meaning they hold a value of 0 and 1 at the same time. Additionally, two qubits can be entangled, with their values linked as if they are one entity, despite sitting on opposite ends of a computer chip.  These unusual properties give quantum computers their game-changing method of calculation. Different possible solutions to a problem can be considered simultaneously, with the wrong answers canceling one another out and the right one being amplified. That allows the computer to quickly converge on the correct solution without needing to check each possibility individually. The concept of quantum computers began gaining steam in the 1990s, when MIT mathematician Peter Shor, then at AT&T Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., discovered that quantum computers could  quickly factor large numbers  ( SN Online: 4/10/14 ). That was a scary prospect for computer security experts, because the fact that such a task is difficult is essential to the way computers encrypt sensitive information. Suddenly, scientists urgently needed to know if quantum computers could become reality. Shor\u2019s idea was theoretical; no one had demonstrated that it could be done in practice. Qubits might be too temperamental for quantum computers to ever gain the upper hand. \u201cIt may be that the whole difference in the computational power depends on this extreme accuracy, and if you don\u2019t have this extreme accuracy, then this computational power disappears,\u201d says theoretical computer scientist Dorit Aharonov of Hebrew University of Jerusalem. But soon, scientists began coming up with error-correction schemes that theoretically could fix the mistakes that slip into quantum calculations and put quantum computers on more solid footing. For classical computers, correcting errors, if they do occur, is straightforward. One simple scheme goes like this: If your bit is a 1, just copy that three times for 111. Likewise, 0 becomes 000. If one of those bits is accidentally flipped \u2014 say, 111 turns into 110, the three bits will no longer match, indicating an error. By taking the majority, you can determine which bit is wrong and fix it.  But for quantum computers, the picture is more complex, for several reasons. First, a principle of quantum mechanics called the no-cloning theorem says that it\u2019s impossible to copy an arbitrary quantum state, so qubits can\u2019t be duplicated.  Secondly, making measurements to check the values of qubits wipes their quantum properties. If a qubit is in a superposition of 0 and 1, measuring its value will destroy that superposition. It\u2019s like opening the box that contains Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat. This imaginary feline of quantum physics is famously  both dead and alive  when the box is closed, but opening it results in a cat that\u2019s entirely dead or entirely alive, no longer in both states at once ( SN: 6/25/16, p. 9 ). So schemes for quantum error correction apply some work-arounds. Rather than making outright measurements of qubits to check for errors \u2014 opening the box on Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat \u2014 scientists perform indirect measurements, which \u201cmeasure what error occurred, but leave the actual information [that] you want to maintain untouched and unmeasured,\u201d Aharonov says. For example, scientists can check if the values of two qubits agree with one another without measuring their values. It\u2019s like checking whether two cats in boxes are in the same state of existence without determining whether they\u2019re both alive or both dead. And rather than directly copying qubits, error-correction schemes store data in a redundant way, with information spread over multiple entangled qubits, collectively known as a logical qubit. When individual qubits are combined in this way, the collective becomes more powerful than the sum of its parts. It\u2019s a bit like a colony of ants. Each individual ant is relatively weak, but together, they create a vibrant superorganism. Those logical qubits become the error-resistant qubits of the final computer. If your program requires 10 qubits to run, that means it needs 10 logical qubits \u2014 which could require a quantum computer with hundreds or even hundreds of thousands of the original, error-prone physical qubits. To run a really complex quantum computation, millions of physical qubits may be necessary \u2014 more plentiful than the ants that discovered a slice of last night\u2019s pizza on the kitchen counter. Creating that more powerful, superorganism-like qubit is the next big step in quantum error correction. Physicists have begun putting together some of the pieces needed, and hope for success in the next few years. Massive excitement accompanied last year\u2019s biggest quantum computing milestone:  quantum supremacy . Achieved by Google researchers in October 2019, it marked the first time a quantum computer was able to solve a problem that is impossible for any classical computer ( SN Online: 10/23/19 ). But the need for error correction means there\u2019s still a long way to go before quantum computers hit their stride. Sure, Google\u2019s computer was able to solve a problem in 200 seconds that the company claimed would have taken the best classical computer 10,000 years. But the task, related to the generation of random numbers, wasn\u2019t useful enough to revolutionize computing. And it was still based on relatively imprecise qubits. That won\u2019t cut it for the most tantalizing and complex tasks, like faster database searches. \u201cWe need a very small error rate \u2026 to run these long algorithms, and you only get those with error correction in place,\u201d says physicist and computer scientist Hartmut Neven, leader of Google\u2019s quantum efforts. So Neven and colleagues have set their sights on an error-correction technique called the surface code. The most buzzed-about scheme for error correction, the surface code is ideal for superconducting quantum computers, like the ones being built by companies including Google and IBM (the same company whose pioneering classical computer helped put John Glenn into space). The code is designed for qubits that are arranged in a 2-D grid in which each qubit is directly connected to neighboring qubits. That, conveniently, is the way superconducting quantum computers are typically laid out.  As in an ant colony with workers and soldiers, the surface code requires that different qubits have different jobs. Some are data qubits, which store information, and others are helper qubits, called ancillas. Measurements of the ancillas allow for checking and correcting of errors without destroying the information stored in the data qubits. The data and ancilla qubits together make up one logical qubit with, hopefully, a lower error rate. The more data and ancilla qubits that make up each logical qubit, the more errors that can be detected and corrected. In 2015, Google researchers and colleagues performed a simplified version of the surface code, using nine qubits arranged in a line. That setup, reported in  Nature ,  could correct a type of error called a bit-flip error , akin to a 0 going to a 1. A second type of error, a phase flip, is unique to quantum computers, and effectively inserts a negative sign into the mathematical expression describing the qubit\u2019s state. Now, researchers are tackling both types of errors simultaneously. Andreas Wallraff, a physicist at ETH Zurich, and colleagues showed that they could detect bit- and phase-flip errors using a seven-qubit computer. They could not yet correct those errors, but they  could pinpoint cases where errors occurred  and would have ruined a calculation, the team reported in a paper published June 8 in  Nature Physics . That\u2019s an intermediate step toward fixing such errors. But to move forward, researchers need to scale up. The minimum number of qubits needed to do the real-deal surface code is 17. With that, a small improvement in the error rate could be achieved, theoretically. But in practice, it will probably require 49 qubits before there\u2019s any clear boost to the logical qubit\u2019s performance. That level of error correction should noticeably extend the time before errors overtake the qubit. With the largest quantum computers now reaching 50 or more physical qubits, quantum error correction is almost within reach. IBM is also working to build a better qubit. In addition to the errors that accrue while calculating, mistakes can occur when preparing the qubits, or reading out the results, says physicist Antonio C\u00f3rcoles of IBM\u2019s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. He and colleagues demonstrated that they could detect errors made when preparing the qubits, the process of setting their initial values, the team reported in 2017 in  Physical Review Letters . C\u00f3rcoles looks forward to a qubit that can  recover from all these sorts of errors . \u201cEven if it\u2019s only a single logical qubit \u2014 that will be a major breakthrough,\u201d C\u00f3rcoles says. In the meantime, IBM, Google and other companies still aim to make their computers useful for specific applications where errors aren\u2019t deal breakers: simulating certain chemical reactions, for example, or enhancing artificial intelligence. But the teams continue to chase the error-corrected future of quantum computing. It\u2019s been a long slog to get to the point where doing error correction is even conceivable. Scientists have been slowly building up the computers, qubit by qubit, since the 1990s. One thing is for sure: \u201cError correction seems to be really hard for anybody who gives it a serious try,\u201d Wallraff says. \u201cLots of work is being put into it and creating the right amount of progress seems to take some time.\u201d  For error correction to work, the original, physical qubits must stay below a certain level of flakiness, called a threshold. Above this critical number, \u201cerror correction is just going to make life worse,\u201d Terhal says. Different error-correction schemes have different thresholds. One reason the surface code is so popular is that it has a high threshold for error. It can tolerate relatively fallible qubits. Imagine you\u2019re really bad at arithmetic. To sum up a sequence of numbers, you might try adding them up several times, and picking the result that came up most often. Let\u2019s say you do the calculation three times, and two out of three of your calculations agree. You\u2019d assume the correct solution was the one that came up twice. But what if you were so error-prone that you accidentally picked the one that didn\u2019t agree? Trying to correct your errors could then do more harm than good, Terhal says.  The error-correction method scientists choose must not introduce more errors than it corrects, and it must correct errors faster than they pop up. But according to a concept known as the threshold theorem, discovered in the 1990s, below a certain error rate, error correction can be helpful. It won\u2019t introduce more errors than it corrects. That discovery bolstered the prospects for quantum computers.  \u201cThe fact that one can actually hope to get below this threshold is one of the main reasons why people started to think that these computers could be realistic,\u201d says Aharonov, one of several researchers who developed the threshold theorem. The surface code\u2019s threshold demands qubits that err a bit less than 1 percent of the time. Scientists recently reached that milestone with some types of qubits, raising hopes that the surface code can be made to work in real computers. But the surface code has a problem: To improve the ability to correct errors, each logical qubit needs to be made of many individual physical qubits, like a populous ant colony. And scientists will need many of these superorganism-style logical qubits, meaning millions of physical qubits, to do many interesting computations.  Since quantum computers currently top out at  fewer than 100 qubits  ( SN: 3/31/18, p. 13 ), the days of million-qubit computers are far in the future. So some researchers are looking at a method of error correction that wouldn\u2019t require oodles of qubits. \u201cEverybody\u2019s very excited, but there\u2019s these questions about, \u2018How long is it going to take to scale up to the stage where we\u2019ll have really robust computations?\u2019 \u201d says physicist Robert Schoelkopf of Yale University. \u201cOur point of view is that actually you can make this task much easier, but you have to be a little bit more clever and a little bit more flexible about the way you\u2019re building these systems.\u201d Schoelkopf and colleagues use small, superconducting microwave cavities that allow particles of light, or photons, to bounce back and forth within. The numbers of photons within the cavities serve as qubits that encode the data. For example, two photons bouncing around in the cavity might represent a qubit with a value of 0, and four photons might indicate a value of 1. In these systems, the main type of error that can occur is the loss of a photon. Superconducting chips interface with those cavities and are used to perform operations on the qubits and scout for errors. Checking whether the number of photons is even or odd can detect that type of error without destroying the data. Using this method, Schoelkopf and colleagues reported in 2016 in  Nature \u00a0that  they can perform error correction that reaches the break-even point . The qubit is just beginning to show signs that it performs better with error correction. \u201cTo me,\u201d Aharonov says, \u201cwhether you actually can correct errors is part of a bigger issue.\u201d The physics that occurs on small scales is vastly different from what we experience in our daily lives. Quantum mechanics seems to allow for a totally new kind of computation. Error correction is key to understanding whether that dramatically more powerful type of calculation is truly possible. Scientists believe that quantum computers will prove themselves to be fundamentally different than the computer that helped Glenn make it into orbit during the space race. This time, the moon shot is to show that hunch is right.  "},

In recent years, researchers have taken to replicating this test in a way that the Italian scientist probably never envisioned \u2014 by dropping atoms. A new study describes the most sensitive atom-drop test so far and shows that Galileo\u2019s gravity experiment still holds up \u2014 even for individual atoms. Two different types of  atoms had the same acceleration  within about a part per trillion, or 0.0000000001 percent, physicists report in a paper in press in  Physical Review Letters . Compared with a previous atom-drop test, the new research is a thousand times as sensitive. \u201cIt represents a leap forward,\u201d says physicist Guglielmo Tino of the University of Florence, who was not involved with the new study. Researchers compared rubidium atoms of two different isotopes, atoms that contain different numbers of neutrons in their nuclei. The team launched clouds of these atoms about 8.6 meters high in a tube under vacuum. As the atoms rose and fell, both varieties accelerated at essentially the same rate, the researchers found. In confirming Galileo\u2019s gravity experiment yet again, the result upholds the equivalence principle, a foundation of Albert Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity, general relativity. That principle\u00a0states that an object\u2019s inertial mass, which determines how much it accelerates when force is applied, is equivalent to its gravitational mass, which determines how strong a gravitational force it feels. The upshot: An object\u2019s acceleration under gravity doesn\u2019t depend on its mass or composition. So far, the equivalence principle has withstood all tests. But atoms, which are subject to the strange laws of quantum mechanics, could reveal its weak points. \u201cWhen you do the test with atoms \u2026 you\u2019re testing the equivalence principle and stressing it in new ways,\u201d says physicist Mark Kasevich of Stanford University. Kasevich and colleagues studied the tiny particles using atom interferometry, which takes advantage of quantum mechanics to make extremely precise measurements. During the atoms\u2019 flight, the scientists put the atoms in a state called a quantum superposition, in which particles don\u2019t have one definite location. Instead, each atom existed in a superposition of two locations, separated by up to seven centimeters. When the atoms\u2019 two locations were brought back together, the atoms interfered with themselves in a way that precisely revealed their relative acceleration. Many scientists think that the equivalence principle will eventually falter. \u201cWe have reasonable expectations that our current theories \u2026 are not the end of the story,\u201d says physicist Magdalena Zych of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, who was not involved with the research. That\u2019s because quantum mechanics \u2014 the branch of physics that describes the counterintuitive physics of the very small \u2014 doesn\u2019t mesh well with general relativity, leading scientists on a hunt for a theory of quantum gravity that could unite these ideas. Many scientists suspect that the new theory will violate the equivalence principle by an amount too small to have been detected with tests performed thus far. But physicists hope to improve such atom-based tests in the future, for example by performing them in space, where objects can free-fall for extended periods of time. An equivalence principle test in space has already been  performed with metal cylinders , but not yet with atoms ( SN: 12/4/17 ). So there\u2019s still a chance to prove Galileo wrong. "},

A photonic quantum computer, which harnesses particles of light, or photons,  performed a calculation that\u2019s impossible for a conventional computer , researchers in China report online December 3 in  Science . That milestone, known as quantum supremacy, has been met only once before, in 2019 by  Google\u2019s quantum computer  ( SN: 10/23/19 ). Google\u2019s computer, however, is based on superconducting materials, not photons. \u201cThis is the first independent confirmation of Google\u2019s claim that you really can achieve quantum supremacy,\u201d says theoretical computer scientist Scott Aaronson of the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cThat\u2019s exciting.\u201d Named Jiuzhang after an ancient Chinese mathematical text, the new quantum computer can perform a calculation in 200 seconds that would take more than half a billion years on the world\u2019s fastest non-quantum, or classical, computer. \u201cMy first impression was, \u2018wow,\u2019\u201d says quantum physicist Fabio Sciarrino of Sapienza University of Rome. Google\u2019s device, called Sycamore, is based on tiny quantum bits made of superconducting materials, which conduct energy without resistance. In contrast, Jiuzhang consists of a complex array of optical devices that shuttle photons around. Those devices include light sources, hundreds of beam splitters, dozens of mirrors and 100 photon detectors. Employing a process called boson sampling, Jiuzhang generates a distribution of numbers that is exceedingly difficult for a classical computer to replicate. Here\u2019s how it works: Photons are first sent into a network of channels. There, each photon encounters a series of beam splitters, each of which sends the photon down two paths simultaneously, in what\u2019s called a quantum superposition. Paths also merge together, and the repeated splitting and merging causes the photons to interfere with one another according to quantum rules. Finally, the number of photons in each of the network\u2019s output channels is measured at the end. When repeated many times, this process produces a distribution of numbers based on how many photons were found in each output. If operated with large numbers of photons and many channels, the quantum computer will produce a distribution of numbers that is too complex for a classical computer to calculate. In the new experiment, up to 76 photons traversed a network of 100 channels. For one of the world\u2019s most powerful classical computers, the Chinese supercomputer Sunway TaihuLight, predicting the results that the quantum computer would get for anything beyond about 40 photons was intractable. While Google was the first to break the quantum supremacy barrier, the milestone is \u201cnot a single-shot achievement,\u201d says study coauthor and quantum physicist Chao-Yang Lu of the University of Science and Technology of China in Hefei. \u201cIt\u2019s a continuous competition between constantly improved quantum hardware and constantly improved classical simulation.\u201d After Google\u2019s quantum supremacy claim, for example, IBM proposed a type of calculation that might allow a supercomputer to perform the task Google\u2019s computer completed, at least theoretically. And achieving quantum supremacy doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that the quantum computers are yet very useful, because the calculations are esoteric ones designed to be difficult for classical computers. The result does boost the profile of photonic quantum computers, which haven\u2019t always received as much attention as other technologies, says quantum physicist Christian Weedbrook, CEO of Xanadu, a Toronto-based company focused on building photonic quantum computers. \u00a0\u201cHistorically, photonics has been the dark horse.\u201d One limitation of Jiuzhang, Weedbrook notes, is that it can perform only a single type of task, namely, boson sampling. In contrast, Google\u2019s quantum computer could be programmed to execute a variety of algorithms. But other types of photonic quantum computers, including Xanadu\u2019s, are programmable. Demonstrating quantum supremacy with a different type of device reveals how rapidly quantum computing is progressing, Sciarrino says. \u201cThe fact that now the two different platforms are able to achieve this regime \u2026 shows that the whole field is advancing in a very mature way.\u201d "},

Entangled quantum particles can retain their interconnected properties even when separated by long distances. Such counterintuitive behavior can be harnessed to allow new types of communication. Eventually, scientists aim to build a global quantum internet that relies on transmitting quantum particles to enable ultrasecure communications by using the particles to create secret codes to encrypt messages.

Quantum bits, or qubits, are analogous to the bits found in conventional computers. But rather than existing in a state of either 0 or 1, as standard bits do, qubits can possess both values simultaneously, enabling new types of calculations impossible for conventional computers. Besides their potential use in quantum computers, molecules can also serve as quantum sensors, devices that can make extremely sensitive measurements, such as sussing out  minuscule electromagnetic forces  ( SN: 3/23/18 ). In Freedman and colleagues\u2019 qubits, a single chromium ion, an electrically charged atom, sits at the center of the molecule. The qubit\u2019s value is represented by that chromium ion\u2019s electronic spin, a measure of the angular momentum of its electrons. Additional groups of atoms are attached to the chromium; by swapping out some of the atoms in those groups, the researchers can change the qubit\u2019s properties to alter how it functions. Recently, Freedman and colleagues crafted molecules to fit one particular need: molecular  qubits that respond to light . Lasers can set the values of the qubits and help read out the results of calculations, the researchers reported in the Dec. 11  Science.  Another possibility might be to create molecules that are biocompatible, Freedman says, so they can be used for sensing conditions inside living tissue. Molecules have another special appeal: All of a given type are exactly the same. Many types of qubits are made from bits of metal or other material deposited on a surface, resulting in slight differences between qubits on an atomic level. But using chemical techniques to build up molecules atom by atom means the qubits are identical, making for better-performing devices. \u201cThat\u2019s something really powerful about the bottom-up approach that chemistry affords,\u201d said Freedman. Scientists are already using individual  atoms and ions  in quantum devices ( SN: 6/29/17 ), but molecules are more complicated to work with, thanks to their multiple constituents.

This kind of molecular gymnastics had never been seen before in other organisms and may represent  a way for archaea to get easy access to their genetic material , researchers report March 2 in  eLife . Some of the observed structures \u201creally look like you take a Slinky and force it open, like a book,\u201d says Karolin Luger, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at the University of Colorado Boulder. \u201cYou would think that this would really contort the DNA in an awful shape, but it actually flows very naturally.\u201d Similar to the cassette tapes she grew up listening to, DNA stores information in a very thin and fragile filament of nucleic acids, says Luger. But unlike the tapes, which often tangled and tore, rendering them useless, the genetic material can be read, split into two like a zipper and replicated without tangles and breaks \u2013\u2013 all while remaining confined in an incredibly small compartment. In 2017, Luger and her colleagues discovered that archaea \u2014 microbes that resemble bacteria under the microscope but are quite distinct \u2014 can  spool their DNA around small proteins  called histones ( SN: 8/10/17 ). This process is strikingly similar to how plants, animals and fungi bend and fold their own genomes into compact, disk-shaped units known as nucleosomes. But nobody knew what these structures looked like in archaea, or how the microbes gained access to their spooled DNA. Using computer simulations and electron microscopy experiments on the genetic material of  Methanothermus fervidus , a heat-loving archaeal species, the researchers found the Slinky-like shapes opened and closed in a clamshell motion. \u201cMy gut reaction was: \u2018Wow! So pretty!\u2019\u201d says Luger. \u201cMy second reaction was: \u2018Of course! This makes so much sense!\u2019\u201d Complex organisms such as humans, palm trees or mushrooms depend on a sophisticated machinery to loosen their highly compacted nucleosomes and gain access to specific genes. Archaea microbes might instead simply be contorting their DNA to turn genes on and off \u2013\u2013 allowing proteins to \u201cread\u201d the genes when the Slinkies open, and cutting off access when they close. Luger now wishes to look at other strange archaea that live in extreme environments to confirm whether these bendable DNA Slinkies are \u201ca general phenomenon, or whether other solutions have been invented for this DNA packaging problem.\u201d "},

CAROL VALADE/AFP via Getty Images", "date": "March 12, 2021 at 6:00 pm", "content": "The ongoing Ebola outbreak in Guinea was most likely sparked by someone infected during the outbreak seven years ago, a new study shows. Viruses from both outbreaks are almost genetically identical, hinting that the virus did not jump from an animal to people, as scientists expected, but that it had lurked hidden in a human body for years. \u201cWith this news, I was really, really shocked,\u201d says Angela Rasmussen, a virologist with Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. Potential cases of Ebola began emerging in the West African nation in late January, and Guinean health officials declared an outbreak on February 14 after  three people tested positive  for the virus. The region hadn\u2019t seen an outbreak since the one in 2013 \u2013 2016, which claimed over 11,000 lives. A  separate, unrelated outbreak in the Congo  was declared on February 7. As of March 6,  29 cases and 13 deaths  had been reported in both countries, according to Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. A genetic analysis found that four viruses from people infected in the Guinea outbreak were the close relatives of viruses that had infected people in 2014, according to a  trio  of  preliminary   reports  posted March 12 at virological.org. Only about a dozen mutations separate these new cases from the 2014 cases. That\u2019s far fewer than the more than 100 mutations scientists expect would accumulate over that period if there were sustained transmission of the virus. The lack of mutations suggests that the newest outbreak did not get its start when a bat virus jumped into humans and began spreading. Rather, the most recent cases appear to be a resurgence of the same strain that caused the 2013 \u2013 2016 Ebola outbreak, carried by someone who was infected back then. Researchers have known that Ebola virus can stick around in the body after recovery. Some cases in West Africa during the 2013 \u2013 2016 outbreak stemmed from  individuals who had been infected and had recovered months , or even  more than a year , earlier. But the new findings show the most recent outbreak began after a five-year lull in cases and suggest that the virus wasn\u2019t replicating during that time, meaning the virus may have gone dormant. The finding \u201csuggests some sort of weird mechanism that hasn\u2019t been seen before,\u201d Rasmussen says, but doesn\u2019t mean that Ebola outbreaks from dormant viruses in humans are going to be happening all the time. Right now, what might have happened is \u201ca mystery. We\u2019ll probably solve [the mechanism], but right now there\u2019s just not very much known about it.\u201d Other recent research backs up the idea that Ebola can lie low in the body for years. Immune proteins that recognize the virus  spiked in the blood in 39 out of 51 people  months after those people recovered, molecular virologist Georgios Pollakis and colleagues reported in the Feb. 18  Nature . Though the team could not find evidence in the blood that the virus was replicating, the roused immune response hints that the virus could be hiding somewhere in the body. \u201cWe were quite surprised to see [that] data,\u201d says Pollakis, of the University of Liverpool in England. For Pollakis, the new developments emphasize the need for continued surveillance and research on diseases that aren\u2019t top-of-mind. \u201cThe biggest lesson is that public health needs serious investment,\u201d Pollakis says. \u201cWe focus on what is [spreading] faster, on the biggest player. And then we leave the virus that doesn\u2019t seem to be a burden for the moment\u2026 now it comes back to haunt us.\u201d\u00a0 Though experts say transmission of the virus from people infected long ago appears to be rare, the outbreak raises fears that Ebola survivors could face new stigmas. Health officials have sprung into action across the region to isolate potential contacts in the current outbreak and vaccinate them and their contacts, a strategy known as  ring vaccination  ( SN: 5/18/18 ). In Guinea, about 500 contacts have been identified, and over 1,600 people vaccinated as of March 5. Still, public health officials may need to alter Ebola vaccination strategies, Rasmussen says. While the current strategy is to control outbreaks with ring vaccination, \u201cwe need to think about maybe having a mass immunization campaign \u2014 not using vaccination as a control strategy but as a prevention strategy.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 "},

A new measurement of the exotic \u201catom\u201d \u2014 consisting of an electron and its antiparticle, a positron \u2014  disagrees with theoretical calculations , scientists report in the Aug. 14  Physical Review Letters . And physicists are at a loss to explain it. A flaw in either the calculations or the experiment seems unlikely, researchers say. And new phenomena, such as undiscovered particles, also don\u2019t provide an easy answer, adds theoretical physicist Jes\u00fas P\u00e9rez R\u00edos of the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society in Berlin. \u201cRight now, the best I can tell you is, we don\u2019t know,\u201d says P\u00e9rez R\u00edos, who was not involved with the new research. Positronium is composed of an electron, with a negative charge, circling in orbit with a positron, with a positive charge \u2014 making what\u2019s effectively  an atom without a nucleus  ( SN: 9/12/07 ). With just two particles and free from the complexities of a nucleus, positronium is appealingly simple. Its simplicity means it can be used to precisely test the theory of quantum electrodynamics, which explains how electrically charged particles interact. A team of physicists from University College London measured the separation between two specific energy levels of positronium, what\u2019s known as its fine structure. The researchers formed positronium by colliding a beam of positrons with a target, where they met up with electrons. After manipulating the positronium atoms with a laser to put them in the appropriate energy level, the team hit them with microwave radiation to induce some of them to jump to another energy level. The researchers pinpointed the frequency of radiation needed to make the atoms take the leap, which is equivalent to finding the size of the gap between the energy levels. While the frequency predicted from calculations was about 18,498 megahertz, the researchers measured about 18,501 megahertz, a difference of about 0.02 percent. Given that the estimated experimental error was only about 0.003 percent, that\u2019s a wide gap. The team searched for experimental issues that could explain the result, but came up empty. Additional experiments are now needed to help investigate the mismatch, says physicist Akira Ishida of the University of Tokyo, who was not involved with the study. \u201cIf there is still significant discrepancy after further precise measurements, the situation becomes much more exciting.\u201d The theoretical prediction also seems solid. In quantum electrodynamics, making predictions involves calculating to a certain level of precision, leaving out terms that are less significant and more difficult to calculate. Those additional terms are expected to be too small to account for the discrepancy. But, \u201cit\u2019s conceivable that you could be surprised,\u201d says theoretical physicist Greg Adkins of Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa., also not involved with the research. If the experiments and the theoretical calculations check out, the discrepancy might be due to a new particle, but that explanation also seems unlikely. A new particle\u2019s effects probably would have shown up in earlier experiments. For example, says P\u00e9rez R\u00edos, positronium\u2019s energy levels could be affected by a hypothetical axion-like particle. That\u2019s a lightweight particle that has the potential to explain dark matter, an invisible type of matter thought to permeate the universe. But if that type of particle was causing this mismatch, researchers would also have seen its effects in measurements of the magnetic properties of the electron and its heavier cousin, the muon. That leaves scientists still searching for an answer, says physicist David Cassidy, a coauthor of the study. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be something surprising. I just don\u2019t know what.\u00ad\u201d "},

Instead, multiple types of bacteria living within millimeters of sea stars\u2019 skin deplete oxygen from the water and effectively  suffocate the animals , researchers report January 6 in  Frontiers in Microbiology . Such microbes thrive when there are high levels of organic matter in warm water and create a low oxygen environment that can make sea stars melt in a puddle of slime. Sea star wasting disease \u2014 which causes lethal symptoms like decaying tissue and loss of limbs \u2014 first gained notoriety in 2013 when sea stars living off the U.S. Pacific Coast died in massive numbers. Outbreaks of the disease had also occurred before 2013, but never at such a large scale. Scientists suspected that a virus or bacterium might be making sea stars sick. That hypothesis was supported in a 2014 study that found  unhealthy animals may have been infected by a virus  ( SN: 11/19/14 ). But the link  vanished when subsequent studies  found no relationship between the virus and dying sea stars, leaving researchers perplexed ( SN: 5/5/16 ).\u00a0 The new finding that a boom of nutrient-loving bacteria can drain oxygen from the water and cause wasting disease \u201cchallenges us to think that there might not always be a single pathogen or a smoking gun,\u201d says Melissa Pespeni, a biologist at the University of Vermont in Burlington who was not involved in the work. Such a complex environmental scenario for killing sea stars \u201cis a new kind of idea for [disease] transmission.\u201d \u00a0 There were certainly many red herrings during the hunt for why sea stars along North America\u2019s Pacific Coast were melting into goo, says Ian Hewson, a marine biologist at Cornell University. In addition to the original hypothesis of a viral cause for sea star wasting disease \u2014 which Hewson\u2019s team  reported in 2014  in  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  but later disproved \u2014 he and colleagues analyzed a range of other explanations, from differences in water temperature to exposing the animals to bacteria. But nothing reliably triggered wasting. \u00a0\u00a0 Then the researchers examined the types of bacteria living with healthy sea stars compared with those living among the animals with wasting disease. \u201cThat was when we had our aha moment,\u201d says Hewson. Types of bacteria known as copiotrophs, which thrive in environments with lots of nutrients, were present around the sea stars at higher levels than normal either shortly before the animals developed lesions or as they did so, Hewson and colleagues found. Bacterial species that survive only in environments with little to no oxygen were also thriving. In the lab, the sea stars began wasting when the researchers added phytoplankton or a common bacterial-growth ingredient to the warm water tubs those microbes and sea stars were living in. \u00a0 Experimentally depleting oxygen from the water had a similar effect, causing lesions in 75 percent of the animals, while none succumbed in the control group. Sea stars breathe by diffusing oxygen over small external projections called skin gills, so the lack of oxygen in the wake of flourishing copiotrophs leaves sea stars struggling for air, the data show. It\u2019s unclear how the animals degrade in low oxygen conditions, but it could be due to massive cell death. Although the disease isn\u2019t caused by a contagious pathogen, it is transmissible in the sense that dying sea stars generate more organic matter that spur bacteria to grow on healthy animals nearby. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a snowball effect,\u201d Hewson says. The team also analyzed tissues from sea stars that had succumbed in the 2013 mass die-off \u2014 which followed a large algal bloom on the U.S. West Coast \u2014 to see if such environmental conditions might explain that outbreak. In fast-growing appendages that help them move, the sea stars that perished had high amounts of a form of nitrogen found in low oxygen conditions \u2014 a sign that those animals may have died from a lack of oxygen. The problem may get worse with climate change, Hewson says. \u201cWarmer waters can\u2019t have as much oxygen [compared with colder water] just by physics alone.\u201d Bacteria, including copiotrophs, also flourish in warm water. \u00a0 But pinpointing the likely cause could help experts better treat sick sea stars in the lab, Hewson says. Some techniques include increasing the oxygen levels in a water tank to make the gas more easily available to sea stars or getting rid of extra organic matter with ultraviolet light or water exchange. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot to figure out with this disease, but I think [this new study] gets us a long way to understanding how it comes about,\u201d Pespeni says.

Taming unruly antimatter with laser light may also allow physicists to measure the properties of antiatoms much more precisely, researchers report in the April 1  Nature . Comparing antiatoms with normal atoms could test some fundamental symmetries of the universe. Lasers can cool atoms by  dampening the atoms\u2019 motion with a barrage of light particles , or photons ( SN: 3/8/21 ). But it\u2019s been hard to laser-cool antimatter because, for one thing, \u201cit\u2019s really difficult to make antimatter,\u201d says Takamasa Momose, a spectroscopist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. To craft antihydrogen atoms, Momose and colleagues mixed antiprotons with positrons, the antiparticles of electrons, at the CERN particle physics lab near Geneva. Over several hours, a laser beam tuned to a specific frequency of UV light slowed the antihydrogen atoms from whizzing around at up to 90 meters per second to about 10 meters per second. Future observations of supercooled antihydrogen could test an idea called  charge-parity-time, or CPT, symmetry  ( SN: 2/19/20 ). This physics principle says that normal atoms should absorb and emit photons with the exact same energies as their antimatter look-alikes. Even the tiniest differences between hydrogen and antihydrogen could undermine modern theories of physics, says study coauthor Makoto Fujiwara, a particle physicist at the Canadian national particle accelerator center, TRIUMF, also in Vancouver. Similarly, Einstein\u2019s theory of gravity predicts that matter and antimatter should fall to Earth at the same rate.

In a painstakingly precise experiment, muons\u2019 gyrations within a magnetic field seem to defy predictions of the standard model of particle physics, which describes known fundamental particles and forces. The result strengthens earlier evidence that muons, the heavy kin of electrons, behave unexpectedly. \u201cIt\u2019s a very big deal,\u201d says theoretical physicist Bhupal Dev of Washington University in St. Louis. \u201cThis could be the long-awaited sign of new physics that we\u2019ve all hoped for.\u201d Muons\u2019 misbehavior could point to the existence of new types of particles that alter muons\u2019 magnetic properties. Muons behave like tiny magnets, each with a north and south pole. The strength of that magnet is tweaked by transient quantum particles that constantly flit into and out of existence, adjusting the muon\u2019s magnetism by an amount known as the muon magnetic anomaly. Physicists can predict the value of the magnetic anomaly by considering the contributions of all known particles. If any fundamental particles are in hiding, their additional effects on the magnetic anomaly could give them away. Muons and electrons share a family resemblance, but muons are about 200 times as massive. That makes muons more sensitive to the effects of hypothetical heavy particles. \u201cThe muon kind of hits the sweet spot,\u201d says Aida El-Khadra of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. To measure the magnetic subtleties of the muon, physicists flung billions of the particles around the huge,  doughnut-shaped magnet  of the Muon g\u22122 experiment at Fermilab in Batavia, Ill. ( SN: 9/19/18 ). Inside that magnet, the orientation of the muons\u2019 magnetic poles wobbled, or precessed. Notably, the rate of that precession  diverged slightly from the standard model expectation , physicists report April 7 in a  virtual seminar , and in a paper published in  Physical Review Letters . \u201cThis is a really complex experiment,\u201d says Tsutomu Mibe of the KEK High Energy Accelerator Research Organization in Japan. \u201cThis is excellent work.\u201d To avoid bias, the team worked under self-imposed secrecy, keeping the final number hidden from themselves as they analyzed the data. At the moment the answer was finally revealed, says physicist Meghna Bhattacharya of the University of Mississippi in Oxford, \u201cI was having goose bumps.\u201d The researchers found a muon magnetic anomaly of 0.00116592040, accurate to within 46 millionths of a percent. The theoretical prediction pegs the number at 0.00116591810. That discrepancy \u201chints toward new physics,\u201d Bhattacharya says. A previous measurement of this type, from an experiment completed in 2001 at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y.,  also seemed to disagree  with theoretical predictions \u00a0( SN: 2/15/01 ). When the new result is combined with the earlier discrepancy, the measurement diverges from the prediction by a statistical measure of 4.2 sigma \u2014 tantalizingly close to the typical five-sigma benchmark for claiming a discovery. \u201cWe have to wait for more data from the Fermilab experiment to really be convinced that this is a real discovery, but it is becoming more and more interesting,\u201d says theoretical physicist Carlos Wagner of the University of Chicago. According to quantum physics, muons are constantly emitting and absorbing particles in a frenzy that makes theoretical calculations of the magnetic anomaly extremely complex. An international team of more than 170 physicists, co-led by El-Khadra, finalized the  theoretical prediction  in December 2020 in  Physics Reports . Many physicists believe that this theoretical prediction is solid, and unlikely to budge with further investigation. But some debate lingers. Using a computational technique called lattice QCD for a particularly thorny part of the calculation gives an estimate that falls  closer to the experimentally measured value , physicist Zoltan Fodor and colleagues report April 7 in  Nature . If Fodor and colleagues\u2019 calculation is correct, \u201cit could change how we see the experiment,\u201d says Fodor, of Pennsylvania State University, perhaps making it easier to explain the experimental results with the standard model. But he notes that his team\u2019s prediction would need to be confirmed by other calculations before being taken as seriously as the \u201cgold standard\u201d prediction. As theoretical physicists continue to refine their predictions, experimental estimates will improve too: Muon g\u22122 (pronounced gee-minus-two) physicists have analyzed only a fraction of their data so far. And Mibe and colleagues are planning an experiment using a different technique at J-PARC, the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex in Tokai, to begin in 2025. If the discrepancy between experiment and prediction holds up, scientists will need to find an explanation that goes beyond the standard model. Physicists already believe that the standard model can\u2019t explain everything that\u2019s out there: The universe seems to be pervaded by invisible dark matter, for example, that standard model particles can\u2019t account for. Some physicists speculate that the explanation for the muon magnetic anomaly may be connected to known puzzles of particle physics. For example, a new particle might simultaneously explain dark matter and the Muon g\u22122 result. Or there may be a connection to unexpected features of  certain particle decays  observed in the LHCb experiment at the CERN particle physics lab near Geneva ( SN: 4/20/17 ), recently strengthened by  new results  posted at arXiv.org on March 22. The Muon g\u22122 measurement will intensify such investigations, says Muon g\u22122 physicist Jason Crnkovic of the University of Mississippi. \u201cThis is an exciting result because it\u2019s going to generate a lot of conversations.\u201d "},

The nickel- and magnesium-rich bits were sifted from more than 6 kilograms of loose sediments collected atop the 2,500-meter-tall summit of Walnumfjellet, says Matthias van Ginneken, a cosmochemist at the University of Kent in England. Their  exotic chemistry doesn\u2019t match Earth rocks , but it does match the proportions of elements seen in a type of meteorite called a carbonaceous chondrite, van Ginneken and his colleagues report March 31 in  Science Advances . Most of the particles range in size from 0.1 to 0.3 millimeters across, and more than half consist of spherules that are fused together into odd-shaped globs. The elemental mix in the spherules closely matches that of particles found at two other far-flung sites in Antarctica\u2014 one more than 2,750 kilometers away \u2014 which suggests that all of the materials originated in the same event. Because the other particles were found in ice cores and dated to about 430,000 years ago, the team presumes that the newly found particles from Walnumfjellet fell then too. \u00a0 The meteor that broke up over Antarctica was between 100 to 150 meters across, the team\u2019s simulations suggest, and probably burst at low altitude. Blast waves may have pummeled a 100,000-square-kilometer area of the ice sheet, the team estimates. The explosion left no crater, but peak temperatures where the plume of hot gases reached Earth\u2019s surface would have hit 5,000\u00b0 Celsius and may have melted up to a few centimeters of ice. A similar airburst over a densely populated area today would result in  millions of casualties  and severely damage an area hundreds of kilometers across ( SN: 5/2/17 ). "},

During three summers in Antarctica over the past two decades, researchers collected more than 2,000 micrometeorites from three snow pits that they\u2019d dug. Extrapolating from this meager sample to the rest of the world, tiny pebbles from space account for  a whopping 5,200 metric tons of weight gain each year , researchers report in the April 15  Earth and Planetary Science Letters . Much of Antarctica is  the perfect repository for micrometeorites  because there\u2019s no liquid water to dissolve or otherwise destroy them, says Jean Duprat, a cosmochemist at Sorbonne University in Paris ( SN: 5/29/20 ). Nevertheless, collecting the samples was no easy chore. First, Duprat and colleagues had to dig down two meters or more to reach layers of snow deposited before 1995, the year when researchers set up a field station at an inland site dubbed Dome C. Then they used ultraclean tools to collect hundreds of kilograms of snow, melt it and sieve the tiny treasures from the frigid water. In all, the team found 808 spherules that had partially melted as they blazed through Earth\u2019s atmosphere and another 1,280 micrometeorites that showed no such damage .  The particles ranged in size from 30 to 350 micrometers across and all together weigh mere fractions of a gram. But the micrometeorites were all found within three areas totaling just a few square meters, the merest fraction of Earth\u2019s surface. Assuming that particles of space dust are just as likely to fall in Antarctica as anywhere else let the team estimate how much dust fell over the entire planet. The team\u2019s findings \u201care a wonderful complement to previous studies,\u201d says Susan Taylor, a geologist at the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory in Hanover, N.H., who was not involved in the new study. That\u2019s because Duprat and colleagues found a lot of the small stuff that would have dissolved elsewhere, she notes. About 80 percent of the micrometeorites originate from comets that spend much of their orbits closer to the sun than Jupiter, the researchers estimate. Much of the rest probably derive from collisions of objects in the asteroid belt. All together, these tiny particles deliver somewhere between 20 and 100 metric tons of carbon to Earth each year, Duprat and colleagues suggest, and could have been  an important source of carbon-rich compounds  such as amino acids early in Earth\u2019s history ( SN: 12/4/20 ).

They are always close to the same size, regardless of the liquid they\u2019re made of or the atmosphere they fall in, according to the first generalized physical model of alien rain. \u201cYou can get raindrops out of lots of things,\u201d says planetary scientist Kaitlyn Loftus of Harvard University, who published  new equations  for what happens to a falling raindrop after it has left a cloud in the April  Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets . Previous studies have looked at rain in specific cases, like the water cycle on Earth or  methane rain on Saturn\u2019s moon Titan  ( SN: 3/12/15 ). But this is the first study to consider rain made from any liquid. \u201cThey are proposing something that can be applied to any planet,\u201d says astronomer Tristan Guillot of the Observatory of the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur in Nice, France. \u201cThat\u2019s really cool, because this is something that\u2019s needed, really, to understand what\u2019s going on\u201d in the atmospheres of other worlds. Comprehending how clouds and precipitation form are important for grasping another world\u2019s climate. Cloud cover can either heat or cool a planet\u2019s surface, and raindrops help transport chemical elements and energy around the atmosphere. Clouds are  complicated  ( SN: 3/5/21 ). Despite lots of data on earthly clouds, scientists don\u2019t really understand how they grow and evolve. Raindrops, though, are governed by a few simple physical laws. Falling droplets of liquid tend to default to similar shapes, regardless of the properties of the liquid. The rate at which that droplet evaporates is set by its surface area. \u201cThis is basically fluid mechanics and thermodynamics, which we understand very well,\u201d Loftus says. She and Harvard planetary scientist Robin Wordsworth considered rain in a variety of different forms, including water on early Earth, ancient Mars and a  gaseous exoplanet called K2 18b  that may host clouds of water vapor ( SN: 9/11/19 ). The pair also considered Titan\u2019s methane rain,  ammonia \u201cmushballs\u201d  on Jupiter and  iron rain on the ultrahot gas giant exoplanet  WASP 76b ( SN: 3/11/20 ). \u201cAll these different condensables behave similarly, [because] they\u2019re governed by similar equations,\u201d she says. The team found that worlds with higher gravity tend to produce smaller raindrops. Still, all the raindrops studied fall within a fairly narrow size range, from about a tenth of a millimeter to a few millimeters in radius. Much bigger than that, and raindrops break apart as they fall, Loftus and Wordsworth found. Much smaller, and they\u2019ll evaporate before hitting the ground (for planets that have a solid surface), keeping their moisture in the atmosphere. Eventually the researchers would like to extend the study to solid precipitation like snowflakes and hail, although the math there will be more complicated. \u201cThat adage that every snowflake is unique is true,\u201d Loftus says. The work is a first step toward understanding precipitation in general, says astronomer Bj\u00f6rn Benneke of the University of Montreal, who discovered water vapor in the atmosphere of K2 18b but was not involved in the new study. \u201cThat\u2019s what we are all striving for,\u201d he says. \u201cTo develop a kind of global understanding of how atmospheres and planets work, and not just be completely Earth-centric.\u201d "},

A helicopter just flew on Mars. NASA\u2019s Ingenuity hovered for about 40 seconds above the Red Planet\u2019s surface, marking the first flight of a spacecraft on another planet. In the wee hours on April 19, the helicopter spun its carbon fiber rotor blades and lifted itself into the thin Martian air. It rose about three meters above the ground, pivoted to look at NASA\u2019s Perseverance rover, took a picture, and settled back down to the ground. \u201cGoosebumps. It looks just the way we had tested it in our test chambers,\u201d Ingenuity project manager MiMi Aung said in a news briefing after the flight. \u201cAbsolutely beautiful flight. I don\u2019t think I can ever stop watching it over and over again.\u201d As data from the flight started coming in to Ingenuity\u2019s mission control room at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif., at about 6:35 a.m. EDT, a hush fell. And then cheers erupted as H\u00e5vard Grip, Ingenuity\u2019s guidance, navigation and control lead, announced: \u201cConfirmed that Ingenuity has performed its first flight, the first flight of a powered aircraft on another planet.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, brilliant. Everyone is super excited,\u201d said mechanical engineer and team member Taryn Bailey. \u201cI would say it\u2019s a success.\u201d The flight, originally scheduled for April 11, was delayed to update the helicopter\u2019s software after a test of the rotor blades showed problems switching from preflight to flight mode. After the reboot, a high-speed spin test April 16 suggested the shift was likely to work, setting the stage for the April 19 flight. \u201cI never let you celebrate fully. Every time we hit a major milestone I\u2019m like, not yet, not yet,\u201d Aung told the team moments after the flight was confirmed. Now is the moment to celebrate, she said. \u201cTake that moment and after that, let\u2019s get back to work and more flights. Congratulations.\u201d This first-ever flight was a test of the technology; Ingenuity won\u2019t do any science during its mission, set to last 30 Martian days from the moment it separated from the rover, the equivalent of 31 days on Earth. But its success proves that powered flight is possible in Mars\u2019 thin atmosphere. Future aerial vehicles on Mars could help rovers or human astronauts scout safe paths through unfamiliar landscapes, or reach tricky terrain that a rover can\u2019t traverse. \u201cTechnology demonstrations are really important for all of us,\u201d said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate. \u201cIt\u2019s taking a tool we haven\u2019t been able to use and putting it in the box of tools we have available for all of our missions at Mars.\u201d Ingenuity\u2019s flight was the culmination of more than seven years of imagining, building, testing and hoping for the flight team. \u201cThat is what building first-of-a-kind systems and flight experiments are all about: design, test, learn from the design, adjust the design, test, repeat until success,\u201d Aung said in a news briefing on April 9. Aung and her team began testing early prototypes of a Mars helicopter in a 7.62-meter-wide test chamber at JPL in 2014. It wasn\u2019t a given that flying on Mars would even be possible, Aung said. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging for many different reasons.\u201d Even though Mars\u2019 gravity is only about one-third of Earth\u2019s, the air\u2019s density is about 1 percent that at sea level on Earth. It\u2019s difficult for the helicopter\u2019s blades to push against that thin air hard enough to get off the ground. Another way to think about it is that the air is thinner on Mars than it is at three times the height of Mount Everest, Ingenuity engineer Amelia Quon of JPL said in the news briefing. \u201cWe don\u2019t generally fly things that high,\u201d Quon said. \u201cThere were some people who doubted we could generate enough lift to fly in that thin Martian atmosphere.\u201d So Quon and her team put the helicopter through a battery of tests over the course of five years. \u201cMy job \u2026 was to make Mars on Earth, and enough of it that we could actually fly our helicopter in it,\u201d Quon said. The Mars simulation chamber could be emptied of Earth air and pumped full of carbon dioxide at Mars-like densities. Some versions of the helicopter were suspended from the ceiling to simulate Mars\u2019 lower gravity. And wind speeds up to 30 meters per second were simulated by a bank of about 900 computer fans blowing at the helicopter. The final version of Ingenuity is light, about 1.8 kilograms. Its blades are longer (about 1.2 meters wingspan) and rotate faster (about 2,400 rotations per minute) than a similar vehicle would need to be able to fly on Earth. By the time the  helicopter hitched a ride to Mars with the Perseverance rover  in July 2020, the engineers were confident the helicopter could fly and remain in control at Mars ( SN: 7/30/20 ). Perseverance  landed in a region called Jezero crater  on February 18 ( SN: 2/22/21 ). The helicopter was folded up beneath Perseverance\u2019s belly under a protective shield until March 21. Over the next few weeks, Perseverance drove around to find a flat spot for Ingenuity to launch. Then Ingenuity slowly unfolded itself and was finally lowered gently to the ground beneath Perseverance on April 3. The rover drove away quickly to get Ingenuity out of its shadow and allow the helicopter to charge its batteries with its solar panel, giving it enough power to survive the freezing Martian night.\u00a0 On April 8 and 9, Ingenuity unfolded its rotor blades and tested their ability to spin in preparation to take to the air. After trouble-shooting the software problem and retesting the rotor blades April 16, the flight got a green light for April 19. It was scheduled for roughly 3:30 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on April 19, which corresponds to 12:30 p.m. Mars time, in the early afternoon. That gave the craft\u2019s solar panel enough time to charge up its batteries for the flight. It was also a time when Perseverance\u2019s weather sensors, called MEDA, suggested the average wind speed would be about six meters per second. Ingenuity had to pilot itself through the flight. That\u2019s partly because of the communication delay \u2014 Mars is far enough from Earth that light signals take about 15 minutes to travel between the two planets. But it\u2019s also because Mars\u2019 thin air makes the helicopter difficult to steer. \u201cThings happen too quickly for a human pilot to react to it,\u201d Quon said. Perseverance filmed the flight from about 65 meters away, at a spot named Van Zyl Overlook. Ingenuity also filmed the flight from its own perspective, with two sets of cameras: Its downward facing navigation cameras capturing the view below it in black and white, and its color cameras scanning the horizon. The team hopes to take up to four more flights over the course of Ingenuity\u2019s mission. The second flight took place early on\u00a0April 22.\u00a0Ingenuity rose five meters into the air, tilted to fly two meters sideways, and spun around to take pictures of its surroundings before landing safely. On the third flight on April 25, Ingenuity flew farther and faster than ever before, even in tests on Earth. The helicopter rose five meters into the air and sped 50 meters horizontally, reaching two meters per second at top speed. The Perseverance rover filmed Ingenuity as it flew in and out of the rover\u2019s field of view, then stuck the landing.    Each subsequent flight will be a little bit more daring and riskier. \u201cWe are going to continually push all the way to the limit of this rotorcraft,\u201d Aung said in the April 19 news briefing. And each one will be a nail-biter: Just one bad landing could end things immediately. Ingenuity has no way to right itself after a fall. That may be the way the mission ends, Aung admitted. \u201cUltimately, we expect the helicopter will meet its limit,\u201d she said. Even if it eventually wipes out in a crash, the engineering team will learn valuable information from how the helicopter eventually fails. At the end of Ingenuity\u2019s mission, Perseverance will drive off, leaving the little helicopter that could behind, and continue its own mission: to search for signs of past life in Jezero crater, and to store rocks for a future mission to return to Earth.

An experimental device on the rover split carbon dioxide molecules into their component parts, creating about 10 minutes\u2019 worth of breathable oxygen. It was also enough oxygen to make tiny amounts of rocket fuel. The instrument, called  MOXIE  (Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment), is about the size of a toaster ( SN: 7/28/20 ). Its job is to break oxygen atoms off carbon dioxide, the primary component of Mars\u2019 atmosphere. It\u2019s like \u201can electrical tree,\u201d says principal investigator Michael Hecht of MIT. \u201cWe breathe in CO 2  and breathe out oxygen.\u201d MOXIE flew to Mars with Perseverance, which  arrived on the Red Planet on February 18  ( SN: 2/22/21 ). On April 20, the instrument warmed up to about 800\u00b0 Celsius and ran for long enough to produce five grams of oxygen. That\u2019s not enough to breathe for very long. But the main reason to make oxygen on Mars isn\u2019t for breathing, Hecht says. It\u2019s for making fuel for the return journey to Earth. \u201cWhen we burn anything, gas in the car or a log in the fireplace, most of what we\u2019re burning is oxygen,\u201d Hecht says. On Earth, we take all that oxygen for granted. \u201cIt\u2019s free here. We don\u2019t think about it.\u201d Future astronauts will have to either bring oxygen with them or make it on Mars. A rocket powerful enough to lift a few astronauts off the Red Planet\u2019s surface would need about 25 metric tons of oxygen \u2014 too much to pack for the journey. MOXIE is a prototype for the device astronauts could use to make rocket fuel in the future. When running at full power, the instrument can create about 10 grams of oxygen per hour. The instrument, powered by Perseverance, will run for about one Martian day at a time. A scaled-up version could run continuously for 26 months before astronauts arrive, Hecht says. MOXIE can\u2019t run continuously because Perseverance needs to divert its power back to its other instruments to continue its science mission of  searching for signs of past life on Mars  ( SN: 1/10/18 ). MOXIE will get a chance to run at least nine more times over the next Martian year (about two Earth years). The success of the technology could set the stage for a permanent research station on Mars, like the McMurdo station in Antarctica, something Hecht would like to someday see. \u201cThat\u2019s not something I expect to see in my lifetime, but something I expect to see progress towards in my lifetime,\u201d he says. \u201cMOXIE brings it closer by a decade.\u201d "},

E. Miyako", "date": "June 22, 2020 at 10:15 am", "content": "Drones that blow pollen-laden bubbles onto blossoms could someday help farmers pollinate their crops. Rather than relying on bees and other pollinating insects \u2014 which are dwindling worldwide as a result of  climate change  ( SN: 7/9/15 ),  pesticide  use ( SN: 10/5/17 ) and other factors \u2014 farmers can spray or swab pollen onto crops themselves. But machine-blown plumes can waste many grains of pollen, and manually brushing pollen onto plants is labor-intensive. Materials chemist Eijiro Miyako of the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology in Nomi imagines outsourcing pollination to automatous drones that deliver pollen grains to individual flowers. His original idea involved  a pollen-coated drone rubbing grains onto flowers , but that treatment damaged the blossoms ( SN: 3/7/17 ). Then, while blowing bubbles with his son, Miyako realized that bubbles might be a gentler means of delivery.\u00a0 To that end, Miyako and his colleague Xi Yang, an environmental scientist also at JAIST, devised a pollen-containing solution that a drone toting a bubble gun could blow onto crops. To test the viability of their pollen-loaded bubbles, the researchers used this technique to pollinate by hand pear trees in an orchard. Those trees  bore about as much fruit as trees pollinated using a traditional method of hand pollination , the researchers report online June 17 in  iScience . Among various commercially available bubble solutions, Miyako and Yang found that pollen grains remained most healthy and viable in one made with lauramidopropyl betaine \u2014 a chemical used in cosmetics and personal care products. Using that solution as their base, the researchers added pollen-protecting ingredients, like calcium and potassium, along with a polymer to make the bubbles sturdy enough to withstand winds generated by drone propellers. The researchers blew pollen bubbles at flowers on three pear trees in an orchard. On average, 95 percent of the 50 pollinated blossoms on each tree formed fruits. That was comparable to another set of three similar trees pollinated by hand with a standard pollen brush. Only about 58 percent of flowers on three trees that relied on insects and wind to deliver pollen bore fruit. To test the feasibility of applying this bubble treatment with flying robots, Miyako and Yang armed a drone with a bubble gun and blew pollen bubbles at fake lilies while flying by at two meters per second. More than 90 percent of the lilies were hit with bubbles, but many more bubbles missed the blooms. Making drone pollination practical would require flying robots that can recognize flowers and deftly target specific blossoms, the researchers say. Not everyone is convinced that building robotic pollinators is a good idea. Simon Potts, a sustainable land management researcher at the University of Reading in England, sees this technology as a \u201cpiece of smart engineering being shoehorned to solve a problem which can be solved in \u2026 more effective and sustainable ways.\u201d In 2018, Potts and colleagues published a study in  Science of the Total Environment , arguing that protecting natural pollinators is  a better way to safeguard plant pollination  than building robotic bees. Insects, the researchers noted, are more adept pollinators than any machine and don\u2019t disrupt existing ecosystems. Miyako and Yang say their bubble solution was biocompatible, but Potts worries that dousing flowers in human-made substances could dissuade insects from visiting those trees.\u00a0\u00a0 Roboticist Yu Gu of West Virginia University in Morgantown, who designs robotic pollinators but was not involved in the new work, says that building robotic bees and supporting insect populations are not mutually exclusive. \u201cWe\u2019re not hoping to take over for bees, or any other natural pollinator,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is complement them.\u201d Where there is a shortage of winged workers to pollinate crops, farmers could one day use robots \u201cas a Plan B,\u201d he says.

But genes that have escaped from genetically modified cotton crops have made some of these native plants fundamentally different, changing their biology and the way they interact with insects. One type of  escaped gene  makes wild cotton exude less nectar. With no means to attract defensive ants that protect it from plant eaters, the cotton is devoured. Another escaped gene makes the wild cotton produce excess nectar, enticing a lot of ants that might keep other insects, including pollinators, at bay, researchers report on January 21 in  Scientific Reports . \u201cThese are profoundly interesting effects,\u201d says Norman Ellstrand, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Riverside. \u201cIt\u2019s the first case that really suggests that a whole ecosystem can be disrupted\u201d after transgenes enter a wild population. The results challenge one long-held view that when genes from genetically modified crops escape into the wild, they have only a neutral effect on wild plants or pass on their benefits to weeds, says Alicia Mastretta Yanes, a plant molecular ecologist at the National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity in Mexico City. The findings confirm that unexpected outcomes of this genetic transfer, some of which \u201cwere never imagined, or at least were not assumed as possible,\u201d do happen sometimes, she says. Scientists have previously tried to  explain what happens  after DNA from genetically modified crops ends up in their wild relatives ( SN: 1/29/16 ). But the majority of studies have been done under carefully controlled conditions, and very few have tested the consequences, if any, of these gene transfers on natural ecosystems. The scarce evidence motivated Ana Wegier, a plant geneticist from the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Mexico City, and her students to find out. The country was their natural lab. The cotton we know ( Gossypium hirsutum ) first appeared and diversified between 2 million and 1.5 million years ago in Mexico, and native variants still sprout across the land. In the last 25 years, vast fields of fluffy genetically engineered cotton have also cropped up across the northern part of the country. During that time, Wegier has explored Mexico searching for wild cotton, only to find it at the edge of cliffs, municipal dumps or the middle of a highway. Wild cotton likes to grow in the most inhospitable locations, where it does not have to compete with other species, she says. In 2018, Wegier and her group traveled to the R\u00eda Lagartos biosphere reserve, an isolated coastal area in the Yucatan Peninsula. With the whitest beaches just a few feet away, the researchers spent long days observing and sampling cotton plants under the scorching sun as swarms of mosquitoes bit them nonstop. Back in Wegier\u2019s city lab, the team extracted DNA from the 61 plants it had collected and found that 24 of the plants did not have any transgenes. Twenty-one plants had a transgene that conferred resistance to the herbicide glyphosate; seven could now produce a lethal toxin that kills destructive insects; and the remaining nine had incorporated both escaped genes into their genetic code. With the closest fields of genetically engineered cotton nearly 2,000 kilometers away, \u201cwhat surprised me the most was how easy it was to find changes where we didn\u2019t expect them,\u201d Wegier says. When slathered in a stress-inducing chemical, the plants with glyphosate resistance produced a lot less nectar than wild plants. The nectar is a sugary snack that wild cotton secretes whenever it\u2019s eaten in exchange for the bodyguard services of particularly aggressive ant species. These plants were also the ones that looked the most ragged before the samples were taken. With no tasty reward to offer, and no ants to protect the cotton from hungry herbivores, these plants suffered the most damage compared with native plants that didn\u2019t have the transgene. Treated with the same chemical, the plants with the insecticide gene exuded nectar all the time, secreting more than the wild plants with no escaped genes and becoming an irresistible beacon to protective ants. But in the researchers\u2019 sample of plants, there weren\u2019t as many with the insecticide gene, suggesting that either the ants or the transgene itself were scaring off other insects. That may have interfered with the pollination of the cotton\u2019s flowers, preventing the plant from reproducing. The findings are intriguing, says Hugo Perales, an agroecologist at the Colegio de la Frontera Sur in Chiapas, Mexico, but he urges for caution. The uncontrollable, real-world environment of R\u00eda Lagartos forced the researchers to work with a very small number of plants, he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a suggestion that something is happening, but this suggestion needs to be verified.\u201d To Wegier, the implications of the study are clear. With Mexico being the reservoir of cotton\u2019s genetic diversity, she argues it would be wise to limit the introduction of more genetically modified variants. \u201cWe know the presence of transgenes is irreversible, and the [ecological] effects are irreversible,\u201d she says.

These antistar candidates seem to give off the kind of gamma rays that are produced when antimatter \u2014 matter\u2019s oppositely charged counterpart \u2014 meets normal matter and annihilates. This could happen on  the surfaces of antistars  as their gravity draws in normal matter from interstellar space, researchers report online April 20 in  Physical Review D . \u201cIf, by any chance, one can prove the existence of the antistars \u2026 that would be a major blow for the standard cosmological model,\u201d says Pierre Salati, a theoretical astrophysicist at the Annecy-le-Vieux Laboratory of Theoretical Physics in France not involved in the work. It \u201cwould really imply a significant change in our understanding of what happened in the early universe.\u201d It\u2019s generally thought that although the universe was born with equal amounts of matter and antimatter, the modern universe  contains almost no antimatter  ( SN: 3/24/20 ). Physicists typically think that as the universe evolved,  some process  led to matter particles vastly outnumbering their antimatter alter egos ( SN: 11/25/19 ). But an instrument on the International Space Station recently cast doubt on this assumption by detecting hints of a few antihelium nuclei. If those observations are confirmed, such stray antimatter could have been shed by antistars. Intrigued by the possibility that some of the universe\u2019s antimatter may have survived in the form of stars, a team of researchers examined 10 years of observations from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. Among nearly 5,800 gamma-ray sources in the catalog, 14 points of light gave off gamma rays with energies expected of matter-antimatter annihilation, but did not look like any other known type of gamma-ray source, such as a pulsar or black hole. Based on the number of observed candidates and the sensitivity of the Fermi telescope, the team calculated how many antistars could exist in the solar neighborhood. If antistars existed within the plane of the Milky Way, where they could accrete lots of gas and dust made of ordinary matter, they could emit lots of gamma rays and be easy to spot. As a result, the handful of detected candidates would imply that only one antistar exists for every 400,000 normal stars. If, on the other hand, antistars tended to exist outside the plane of the galaxy, they would have much less opportunity to accrete normal matter and be much harder to find. In that scenario, there could be up to one antistar lurking among every 10 normal stars. But proving that any celestial object is an antistar would be extremely difficult, because besides the gamma rays that could arise from matter-antimatter annihilation, the light given off by antistars is expected to look just like the light from normal stars. \u201cIt would be practically impossible to say that [the candidates] are actually antistars,\u201d says study coauthor Simon Dupourqu\u00e9, an astrophysicist at the Institute of Research in Astrophysics and Planetology in Toulouse, France. \u201cIt would be much easier to disprove.\u201d Astronomers could watch how gamma rays or radio signals from the candidates change over time to double-check that these objects aren\u2019t really pulsars. Researchers could also look for optical or infrared signals that might indicate the candidates are actually black holes. \u201cObviously this is still preliminary \u2026 but it\u2019s interesting,\u201d says Julian Heeck, a physicist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville not involved in the work. The existence of antistars would imply that substantial amounts of antimatter somehow managed to survive in isolated pockets of space. But Heeck doubts that antistars, if they exist, would be abundant enough to account for all the universe\u2019s missing antimatter. \u201cYou would still need an explanation for why matter overall dominates over antimatter.\u201d "},

Lead-208\u2019s nucleus is approximately spherical, a ball of protons embedded within a slightly bigger ball of neutrons. Measuring the difference between the sizes of the spheres reveals the thickness of lead\u2019s sleek neutron skin. Gauging the size of the proton sphere is relatively straightforward: Physicists can shoot electrically charged particles at the nucleus and study how the particles scatter away from the positively charged protons. But because neutrons don\u2019t have an electric charge, the volume they enclose is harder to measure. So researchers with the Lead Radius Experiment, or PREX-II, at Jefferson Lab in Newport News, Va., used a special technique. The team measured how electrons scattered differently from the nucleus according to their spin, or angular momentum. Because electrons interact with neutrons at different rates depending on the direction of their spin, the experiment revealed the width of the neutron sphere, allowing researchers to calculate the neutron skin thickness. The neutron skin was slightly thicker than physicists had predicted.

Together the measurements could help scientists better understand theories of the atomic nucleus and other realms where neutrons are crammed together such as in  neutron stars , extremely dense, dead stars composed mainly of neutrons ( SN: 4/20/21 ).

The helicopter arrived at Mars with two main goals: demonstrate that flight was possible on the Red Planet and show that it could return critical flight data to Earth. Those were both achieved in  Ingenuity\u2019s first flight  on April 19 and then surpassed as the helicopter flew farther, higher and faster on April 22 and April 25 ( SN: 4/19/21 ). The original plan was for Ingenuity to take up to six flights total, then ground itself forever as Perseverance drove away to do science. That was partly because the Perseverance team expected to drive far from the  rover\u2019s landing site  in search of rocks that might preserve signs of past Martian life ( SN: 2/22/21 ). \u201cWe thought we would be doing an intensive drive campaign in which the helicopter would not be able to keep up,\u201d said Perseverance project scientist Ken Farley of Caltech in the briefing. \u201cBut based on the rocks we have seen in the area, we really wish to spend a considerable amount of time where we are.\u201d Ingenuity has also been performing surprisingly well, Aung said. The rover and the helicopter might be able to communicate from more than a kilometer apart, giving them both more flexibility. Ingenuity took its fourth flight on April 30 to scout for a new launch pad. The fifth flight, to be scheduled after the team has examined the data, will be a one-way journey to that new home. After that, Ingenuity will switch into support mode. Up until now, the Perseverance team has generously supported the helicopter, Aung said. \u201cThe rover is primary going forward,\u201d she said. The helicopter will have future flights in support mode.

J. Dietrich/ESO", "date": "May 5, 2021 at 7:00 am", "content": " rare glimpse of a star before it exploded in a fiery supernova looks nothing like astronomers expected, a new study suggests. Images from the Hubble Space Telescope reveal that a relatively cool, puffy star ended its life in a hydrogen-free supernova. Until now, supernovas without hydrogen were thought to originate only from extremely hot, compact stars. The discovery \u201cis a very important test case for stellar evolution,\u201d says Sung-Chul Yoon, an astrophysicist at Seoul National University in South Korea, who was not involved in the work. Theorists have some ideas about how massive stars behave right before they blow up, but such hefty stars are scant in the local universe and many are nowhere near ready to go supernova, Yoon says. Retroactively identifying the star responsible for a supernova provides an opportunity to test scenarios of how stars evolve right before exploding. Finding those stars, however, is difficult, explains Charlie Kilpatrick, an astronomer at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. A telescope must have looked at that exact region of the sky in the years leading up to the supernova. And the explosion must have happened close enough for light from its much fainter source star to have reached a telescope. Although both conditions are tricky to meet, Kilpatrick is undaunted by the hunt. After scientists discovered a supernova in December 2019, in a galaxy called NGC 4666 about 46 million light-years away, he and colleagues rushed to check old Hubble observations from the same region of the sky. They wanted to find the star behind the explosion, dubbed SN 2019yvr. After poring over images and cross-checking observations with those from ground-based telescopes, the team found their quarry: a star at the same spot as the supernova, observed about 2.6 years before the explosion. It appeared to be a yellow star about 6,500\u00b0 Celsius and about 320 times wider than the sun. \u201cI was kind of puzzled by all that,\u201d Kilpatrick says. The supernova SN 2019yvr lacked hydrogen, so its progenitor was expected to be hydrogen-deficient, too. But \u201cif a star lacks a hydrogen envelope, then you expect to be seeing deeper inside of the star to the hotter layers,\u201d Kilpatrick says. That is, the star should have looked extremely hot and blue and compact \u2014 maybe 10,0000 to 50,000\u00b0 C, and no more than 50 times wider than the sun. The cool, large, yellow progenitor of SN 2019yvr, on the other hand,  appeared to be padded with lots of hydrogen . The researchers report the results May 5 in the  Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society . For this kind of star to have produced a supernova like SN 2019yvr, it must have shed much of its hydrogen before blowing up, Kilpatrick says. But how? He and colleagues have come up with a couple scenarios. The star could have expelled much of its hydrogen into space through violent eruptions, possibly caused by some instability in the star\u2019s core or interference from another star nearby. Or perhaps the star\u2019s hydrogen could have been stripped off by another star that was in orbit around it. To whittle these possibilities down, Jan Eldridge, an astrophysicist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, suggests turning the Hubble telescope back on that area of the sky. Astronomers should first make sure that the star seen 2.6 years before SN 2019yvr really is gone now, says Eldridge, who was not involved in the work. Researchers could also check whether a star that once orbited SN 2019yvr\u2019s progenitor still remains. \u201cThey\u2019ve found a mystery, and they\u2019ve got some solutions,\u201d Eldridge notes. Trying to figure out how such an unlikely star pulled off this particular supernova, she says, \u201cis going to be fun.\u201d "},

That core isn\u2019t the lump of rock and ice that many scientists had envisioned, the new study finds. Instead, the core is diffuse, pervaded by huge amounts of hydrogen and helium and so spread out that  it spans 70,000 kilometers , or about 60 percent of the planet\u2019s diameter, researchers report April 28 at arXiv.org. The new intel should help planetary scientists better understand not only how giant planets formed in our solar system but also the nature of such worlds orbiting other stars.\u00a0\u00a0 To ascertain the structure of Saturn\u2019s core, astronomer Christopher Mankovich and astrophysicist Jim Fuller, both at Caltech, examined the giant planet\u2019s rings. Just as earthquakes help seismologists probe Earth\u2019s interior, oscillations inside Saturn can reveal its internal composition. These oscillations alter Saturn\u2019s gravitational forces, inducing  waves in the rings  \u2014especially the C ring, which is the nearest of the three main rings to the planet ( SN: 1/22/19 ). By analyzing a wave in that ring, along with data on Saturn\u2019s gravity field from the  now-defunct Cassini spacecraft  ( SN: 9/15/17 ), Mankovich and Fuller found that the core has about 17 Earth masses of rock and ice. But there\u2019s so much hydrogen and helium mixed in, the core encompasses 55 Earth masses altogether \u2014 more than half of Saturn\u2019s total, which is equivalent to the mass of 95 Earths. This \u201cring seismology\u201d work will appear in a future  Nature Astronomy . \u201cIt\u2019s a new way to look at gas giant planets in the solar system,\u201d says Ravit Helled, a planetary scientist at the University of Zurich who was not involved with the work. \u201cThis knowledge is important because it reflects on our understanding of giant exoplanets,\u201d and indicates that giant planets in other solar systems probably have more complex structures than many researchers had thought. The discovery also illuminates how Saturn formed, says Nadine Nettelmann, a planetary scientist at the German Aerospace Center in Berlin. Older theories posited that a gas giant such as Saturn arises when rock and ice orbiting the sun start to conglomerate. Tenuous gaseous envelopes let additional solid materials sink to the center, forming a compact core. Only later, according to this theory, does the core attract lots of hydrogen and helium \u2014 the ingredients that make up most of the planet. Although these elements are gases on Earth, Saturn\u2019s great gravity squeezes most of them into a fluid. But newer theories say instead that plenty of gas got incorporated into the core of rock and ice when it was taking shape 4.6 billion years ago. As the planet accreted additional mass, the proportion of gas rose. The structure Mankovich and Fuller deduce for Saturn\u2019s core preserves this formation history, Nettelmann says, because the planet\u2019s very center, representing the oldest part of Saturn, has the greatest proportion of rock and ice. The fraction of rock and ice decrease gradually rather than abruptly from the core\u2019s center to its edge, reflecting the core\u2019s development over time. \u201cI find the conclusions very important and very exciting and the line of reasoning very convincing,\u201d Nettelmann says. Still, she cautions that additional waves in the rings should be analyzed for confirmation. The type of oscillation that Mankovich and Fuller detect inside Saturn also implies that the core is stable rather than bubbling like a pot of water on a hot stove, which is one way a planet can carry heat from its hot interior outward. The core\u2019s stability may help explain a long-standing puzzle: why Saturn emits more energy than it gets from the sun. After the planet formed, it was warm with the heat of its birth, but then it cooled off. The core\u2019s stability could have put a lid on some of this cooling, however, which helped the planet retain heat that it still radiates to this day. In contrast, if the core had instead transported heat via the upwelling and downwelling of material, the planet would have cooled off faster and no longer give off so much heat. "},

The threat looms large for  food staples of the world  such as rice, wheat, potatoes and maize ( SN: 9/22/05 ). Pathogenic fungi are also coming for our coffee, sugarcane, bananas and other economically important crops. Annually, fungal diseases destroy a third of all harvests and pose a dire threat to global food security. To stop the spread of fungal diseases, farmers fumigate the soil with toxic chemicals that lay waste to the land, sparing not even the beneficial microbes teeming in the earth. Or they ply plants with fungicides. But fungicide use is effective only in the short run \u2014 until the pathogenic fungi evolve resistance against these synthetic chemicals. Now, a new idea is taking root: Help plants stand their ground by giving them the tools to fight their own battles. A team led by Jason White, an environmental toxicologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, is fortifying crops with nutrients fashioned into nanosized packages, which boost plants\u2019 innate immunity against pathogenic fungi more efficiently than traditional plant feeding. Over the past few years, the researchers have devised various nanonutrient concoctions that boost the fungal resistance of soybeans,  tomatoes ,  watermelons  and, recently,  eggplants , as reported in the April  Plant Disease . The concept \u201ctackles the challenge at the origin rather than trying to put a Band-Aid on the [problem],\u201d says Leanne Gilbertson, an environmental engineer at the University of Pittsburgh who was not involved in the research. White\u2019s strategy provides plants with the nutrients they need to trigger enzyme production to guard against pathogenic attack. Without any synthetic chemicals introduced, the strategy sidesteps any opportunity for malignant fungi to develop resistances, she says. The researchers\u2019 nanomaterials approach is inspired by their earlier discovery that nanoparticles transported up from the roots of maize can loop back down from the leaves. The researchers dipped half of the root fibers of a single maize plant in a copper nanoparticle formulation and the other half in pure water. The copper showed up in the water-dipped roots, pointing to a  roots-to-shoot-to-roots roundtrip , White and his colleagues reported in 2012 in  Environmental Science & Technology . That finding suggested that nanoparticles can be applied directly to the leaves in the first place, even when the target destination was the roots. Using the leaves as an entrance point gets around a perennial problem: Delivering dissolved nutrients through the soil is hardly efficient. Chemicals may break down in the soil, vaporize into the atmosphere or leach away. Only about 20 percent of watered nutrients eventually reach the target areas in a plant. \u201cBy using the nanoscale form, we can actually more effectively deliver [nutrients] where we want it and where the plant needs it,\u201d White says. To see if this approach could deliver nutrients specifically needed in defense against hostile fungi, White and colleagues carried out tests in eggplants and tomatoes. The team sprayed metallic nanoparticles onto the leaves and shoots of young plants, then infected the plants with pathogenic fungi. The nanoparticle-treated plants had  elevated levels of nutritional metals in the roots and higher produce yields  compared with the plants fed readily dissolved nutrients, the team reported in 2016 in  Environmental Science: Nano . The nanoparticles weren\u2019t harming the fungi, the researchers found: The fungi still thrived amidst nanoparticles in the environment without the host plant present. Instead, the nanoparticles\u2019 antifungal properties stem from providing plant nourishment \u2014 equivalent to humans taking nutritional supplements \u2014 that allows plants to mount an appropriate defense on demand. What makes nanonutrients more potent than common fertilizers is the sweet spot in their sizes, which control how fast they dissolve, says Fabienne Schwab, an environmental chemist not involved in the research. Nanonutrients are thousands of times smaller than the diameter of human hair and thousands of times larger than readily dissolved nutrient salts. They have a large, exposed surface, so they dissolve more quickly than a heftier chunk of the same nutrient. Yet nanonutrients are big enough that that they don\u2019t dissolve all at once: They can gradually release the nutrients over weeks. In contrast, readily dissolved nutrients give plants a temporary nutrient spike, akin to a sugar rush. \u201cWhen you use [nutrients] at the nanoscale, you can tune the solubility pretty much the way you like,\u201d says Schwab, of the Adolphe Merkle Institute in Fribourg, Switzerland. It\u2019s not just the size that can be tuned \u2014 the shape, composition and surface chemistries can be modified to stimulate different levels of a plant\u2019s responses. For instance, White and his collaborators found that nanometer-thin copper oxide sheets were better than spherical copper nanoparticles at preventing  Fusarium virguliforme  infection in soybeans. The key to their effectiveness lay in the nanosheets\u2019 quicker release of charged copper atoms and stronger adhesion to leaf surfaces. The copper nanomaterials  restored  the soybean\u2019s masses and photosynthesis rates to the levels of disease-free plants, the team reported in  Nature Nanotechnology  in 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s a very promising technology,\u201d says Schwab, but she adds that there are other aspects to consider before its implementation. If agricultural nanotechnology is to achieve widespread use, it needs to observe environmental and safety regulations, as well as \u2014 perhaps even more challengingly \u2014 overcome consumer wariness. So far, White and his collaborators found no residual nanonutrients in their produce that would end up on the dining table of consumers. But other implications, such as the nanomaterials\u2019 persistence in the environment and hazards posed to human handlers, have yet to be fully understood. \u201cPeople in general get nervous when you talk about nanotechnology and food,\u201d says White. But he says his group isn\u2019t using any exotic materials, whose health impacts remain complete enigmas. Instead \u201cwe\u2019re using nutrients the plants need [that] they just can\u2019t get enough of.\u201d White says he has eaten the eggplants, tomatoes and watermelons he\u2019s grown for his research. And perhaps that\u2019s the best reassurance consumers can get: a toxicologist trying the literal fruit of his labor. "},

But even for mangroves, there is a \u201cremarkable\u201d amount of carbon stored in small  pockets of forest growing around sinkholes  on Mexico\u2019s Yucatan Peninsula, researchers report May 5 in  Biology Letters . These forests can stock away more than five times as much carbon per hectare as most other terrestrial forests. There are dozens of mangrove-lined sinkholes, or cenotes, on the peninsula. Such carbon storage hot spots could help nations or companies achieve  carbon neutrality  \u2014 in which the volume of greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere is balanced by the amount of carbon sequestered away ( SN: 1/31/20 ). At three cenotes, researchers led by Fernanda Adame, a wetland scientist at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, collected samples of soil at depths down to 6 meters, and used carbon-14 dating to estimate how fast the soil had accumulated at each site. The three cenotes each had \u201cmassive\u201d amounts of soil organic carbon, the researchers report, averaging about 1,500 metric tons per hectare. One site, Casa Cenote, stored as much as 2,792 metric tons per hectare. Mangrove roots make ideal traps for organic material. The submerged soils also help preserve carbon. As sea levels have slowly risen over the last 8,000 years, mangroves have kept pace, climbing atop sediment ported in from rivers or migrating inland. In the cave-riddled limestone terrain of the Yucatan Peninsula, there are no rivers to supply sediment. Instead, \u201cthe mangroves produce more roots to avoid drowning,\u201d which also helps the trees climb upward more quickly, offering more space for organic matter to accumulate, Adame says. As global temperatures increase, sea levels  may eventually rise too quickly for mangroves to keep up  ( SN: 6/4/20 ). Other, more immediate threats to the peninsula\u2019s carbon-rich cenotes include groundwater pollution, expanding infrastructure, urbanization and tourism. "},

Researchers who unearthed the ancient youngster\u2019s remains say that they\u2019ve found the  oldest known intentional human burial in Africa . The investigators, who report the discovery in the May 6  Nature , have named the ancient youngster Mtoto, a Swahili word that means \u201cchild.\u201d \u201cMtoto was buried in a sheltered part of a cave that was repeatedly occupied by people over a span of nearly 80,000 years, up to about 500 years ago,\u201d said archaeologist Michael Petraglia of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany, at a May 3 news conference. Local people still visit this spot to worship and conduct rituals. Mtoto\u2019s discovery suggests that \u201ca  tradition of symbolically significant burials , at least for the very young, might have been culturally embedded in parts of Africa\u201d toward the end of the Middle Stone Age, which ran from around 320,000 to 30,000 years ago, writes bioarchaeologist Louise Humphrey of the National History Museum in London in a comment published with the new paper. Excavations at Panga ya Saidi, or PYS, a cave site located in forested hills about 15 kilometers from Kenya\u2019s coast, revealed Mtoto\u2019s grave. Petraglia and Max Planck archaeologist Nicole Boivin led work there starting in 2010. Preliminary signs of Mtoto\u2019s burial appeared in 2013. Digging revealed part of a shallow pit, but fragmentary bones visible in the pit were too fragile to remove or study closely. Stone tools typical of Africa\u2019s Middle Stone Age had turned up in the same sediment, giving researchers a sense of how old the bones were. Lab analyses indicated that the sediment had last been exposed to sunlight about 78,300 years ago. Investigators excavated the entire pit in 2017 and covered it in plaster for transport to the National Museums of Kenya in Nairobi. There, researchers noticed that two teeth in the pit looked human. The plastered pit was then sent to paleoanthropologist Mar\u00eda Martin\u00f3n-Torres at the National Research Center on Human Evolution in Burgos, Spain. After removing plaster around the earthen block, her team used CT imaging to create digital versions of the PYS bones, revealing a  Homo sapiens  child\u2019s partial skeleton. Fossil positions indicated that the child had been placed on his or her right side, with knees bent up toward the chest. Many bones were intact enough to be removed from the pit. The size and development of the two teeth in the pit indicated that the child had died at age 2.5 to 3 years. Microscopic study of the fossils and chemical analyses of pit sediment indicated that the child\u2019s body was interred soon after death, before decomposition began. That explains why parts of the child\u2019s skeleton remain well-preserved, including a skull base connected to three neck bones. Special care was taken in burying Mtoto, Martin\u00f3n-Torres said. For instance, the skull base and attached neck bones had collapsed away from other back bones in a way suggesting that the child\u2019s head originally lay on a support or pillow that had decayed. Rotation of a collarbone and two ribs suggested that Mtoto\u2019s upper body had originally been wrapped in a shroud. An infant found in a pit inside southern Africa\u2019s Border Cave in 1941  has previously been cited as Africa\u2019s earliest burial. But evidence for that argument remains uncertain, Petraglia said. The Border Cave infant dates to between 74,000 and 58,000 years ago. Even if it\u2019s true Mtoto is the oldest burial in Africa, more Middle Stone Age burials have been found in Eurasia and the Middle East than in Africa. Humans were buried in an  Israeli cave more than 90,000 years ago  ( SN :  10/29/03 ). And  Neandertals may have buried their dead  in an Iraqi Kurdistan cave 60,000 to 70,000 years ago ( SN : 2/18/20 ). Mtoto and the possible Border Cave burial fit a Middle Stone Age pattern in Eurasia of regularly interring infants and children in public spots, says archaeologist Jo\u00e3o Zilh\u00e3o of the University of Barcelona, who was not involved in the study. After around 30,000 years ago,  Eurasian infants and children were buried in remote locations  ( SN : 5/8/99 ), unlike teens and adults, he says. It\u2019s not clear why age-related differences in the treatment of the dead occurred at that time. Many Middle Stone Age Africans may have buried the dead of all ages away from living areas, not in caves where people continued to live, says archaeologist Lyn Wadley of University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, who also was not involved in the study. If that\u2019s the case, finding more African burials from Mtoto\u2019s time will most likely be a challenge. \u201cOpen-air burials are not easy to find and preservation is likely to be poor,\u201d she says.

And, unlike similar tiny, single-celled organisms that live deep in sediments and munch on decaying plant matter, these archaea don\u2019t produce the climate-warming gas methane, researchers report April 23 in  Nature Communications . \u201cMicroorganisms are the most diverse and abundant form of life on Earth, and we just know 1 percent of them,\u201d says Valerie De Anda, an environmental microbiologist at the University of Texas at Austin. \u201cOur information is biased toward the organisms that affect humans. But there are a lot of organisms that drive the main chemical cycles on Earth that we just don\u2019t know.\u201d Archaea are  a particularly mysterious group  ( SN: 2/14/20 ). It wasn\u2019t until the late 1970s that they were recognized as a third domain of life, distinct from bacteria and eukaryotes (which include everything else, from fungi to animals to plants). For many years, archaea were thought to exist only in the most extreme environments on Earth, such as hot springs. But archaea are actually everywhere, and these microbes can play a big role in how carbon and nitrogen cycle between Earth\u2019s land, oceans and atmosphere. One group of archaea, Thaumarchaeota, are the  most abundant microbes in the ocean , De Anda says ( SN: 11/28/17 ). And  methane-producing archaea in cows\u2019 stomachs  cause the animals to burp large amounts of the gas into the atmosphere ( SN: 11/18/15 ). Now, De Anda and her colleagues have identified an entirely new phylum \u2014 a large branch of related organisms on the tree of life \u2014 of archaea. The first evidence of these new organisms were within sediments from seven hot springs in China as well as from the deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of California. Within these sediments, the team found bits of DNA that it meticulously assembled into the genetic blueprints, or genomes, of 15 different archaea. The researchers then compared the genetic information of the genomes with that of thousands of previously identified genomes of microbes described in publicly available databases. But \u201cthese sequences were completely different from anything that we know,\u201d De Anda says. She and her colleagues gave the new group the name Brockarchaeota, for Thomas Brock, a microbiologist who was the first to grow archaea in the laboratory and who  died in April . Brock\u2019s discovery paved the way for polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, a Nobel Prize\u2013winning technique used to copy small bits of DNA, and currently  used in tests for COVID-19  ( SN: 3/6/20 ). Brockarchaeota, it turns out, actually live all over the world \u2014 but until now, they were overlooked, undescribed and unnamed. Once De Anda and her team had pieced together the new genomes and then hunted for them in public databases, they discovered that bits of these previously unknown organisms had been found in hot springs, geothermal and hydrothermal vent sediments from South Africa to Indonesia to Rwanda. Within the new genomes, the team also hunted for genes related to the microbes\u2019 metabolism \u2014 what nutrients they consume and what kind of waste they produce. Initially, the team expected that \u2014 like other archaea previously found in such environments \u2014 these archaea would be methane producers. They do munch on the same materials that methane-producing archaea do: one-carbon compounds like methanol or methylsulfide. \u201cBut we couldn\u2019t identify the genes that produce methane,\u201d De Anda says. \u201cThey are not present in Brockarchaeota.\u201d That means that these archaea must have a previously undescribed metabolism, through which they can recycle carbon \u2014 for example in sediments on the seafloor \u2014 without producing methane. And, given how widespread they are, De Anda says, these organisms could be playing a previously hidden but significant role in Earth\u2019s carbon cycle. \u201cIt\u2019s twofold interesting \u2014 it\u2019s a new phylum and a new metabolism,\u201d says Luke McKay, a microbial ecologist of extreme environments at Montana State University in Bozeman. The fact that this entire group could have remained under the radar for so long, he adds, \u201cis an indication of where we are in the state of microbiology.\u201d But, McKay adds, the discovery is also a testimonial to the power of metagenomics, the technique by which researchers can painstakingly tease apart individual genomes out of a large hodgepodge of microbes in a given sample of water or sediments. Thanks to this technique, researchers are identifying more and more parts of the previously mysterious microbial world. \u201cThere\u2019s so much out there,\u201d De Anda says. And \u201cevery time you sequence more DNA, you start to realize that there\u2019s more out there that you weren\u2019t able to see the first time.\u201d "},

That stiffness stemmed from a boomerang-shaped bit of bone that braced what would have been an otherwise flexible jawbone, a new analysis suggests. Unlike mammals, reptiles and their close kin have a joint dubbed the intramandibular joint within their lower jawbone, or mandible. New computer simulations show that with a bone spanning the IMJ,  T. Rex  could have generated bite forces of more than 6 metric tons , or about the weight of a large male African elephant, researchers reported April 27 at the virtual annual meeting of the American Association of Anatomy.\u00a0 In today\u2019s lizards, snakes and birds, the IMJ is bound by ligaments, making it relatively flexible, says study author John Fortner, a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Missouri in Columbia. That flexibility helps the animals maintain a better grip on struggling prey and also allows the mandible to flex wider to accommodate larger morsels, he notes. But in turtles and crocodiles, for example, evolution has driven the IMJ to be rather tight and inflexible, enabling strong bite forces. Until now, most researchers have presumed that dinosaurs had lower jaws with a flexible IMJ, but there\u2019s a big flaw with that premise, Fortner notes. A flexible jaw wouldn\u2019t have enabled bone-crushing bite forces, but fossil evidence \u2014 including coprolites, or fossil poop, filled with partially digested bone shards \u2014 strongly suggests that  T. rex  could indeed chomp down with such forces   ( SN: 10/22/18 ). \u201cThere\u2019s every reason to believe that  T. rex  could bite really hard, kinda off the charts,\u201d says Lawrence Witmer, a vertebrate paleontologist at Ohio University in Athens who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice to know how they could carry off these bite forces.\u201d Using a 3-D scan of a fossil  T. rex  skull, Fortner and his colleagues created a computer simulation of the mandible that could be used to analyze stresses and strains, akin to the way engineers analyze bridges and aircraft parts. Then they created two versions of the virtual jawbone. In both of them, they cut in half a boomerang-shaped bone, called the prearticular, that is adjacent to but spans the IMJ. Then, in one simulation, they joined the two sides of the IMJ with virtual ligaments that rendered the jawbone flexible. In a second version of the simulation, the team virtually rejoined the two pieces of the prearticular with bone rather than ligaments. The team\u2019s simulations showed that when the severed prearticular was virtually rejoined with ligaments, stresses couldn\u2019t be effectively transferred from one side of the IMJ to another, says Fortner. In that scenario, the mandible became too flexible to generate large bite forces. But when the pieces of the prearticular were rejoined with bone \u2014 similar to having the bone remain intact \u2014 stresses could be smoothly and efficiently transferred from one side of the joint to another. The team\u2019s findings \u201care potentially interesting,\u201d says Witmer. \u201cThe prearticular is not a particularly big bone, but it could be involved in the bite,\u201d he notes. The  T. rex  mandible is a complicated arrangement of various bones, but \u201cthe prearticular seems to lock the system together,\u201d says Thomas Holtz, Jr., a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland in College Park who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. These simulations show \u201cit provides a demonstrable benefit.\u201d In the future, Fortner and his colleagues will conduct similar analyses for the mandibles of other dinosaurs in the  T. rex  lineage to see how the arrangements of constituent bones, and particularly the IMJ, might have evolved over time. The results of such studies could be quite interesting, says Holtz. Dinosaurs near the base of the  T. rex  family tree had jawbones that were shaped differently, and they didn\u2019t have bones to brace the IMJ, he notes. These theropods, or bipedal meat-eating dinosaurs, also had bladelike teeth rather than the banana-shaped teeth of  T. rex , so they probably had a vastly different feeding style. In those ancestors, Holtz notes, a flexible IMJ may have served as a \u201cshock absorber\u201d when chomping down or during attacks on prey. "},

But a new experiment suggests that clocks\u2019 precision comes at a price: entropy. Entropy, or disorder, is created each time a clock ticks. Now, scientists have measured the entropy generated by a clock that can be run at varying levels of accuracy. The more accurate the clock\u2019s ticks,  the more entropy it emitted , physicists report in a paper accepted to  Physical Review X . \u201cIf you want a better clock, you have to pay for it,\u201d says physicist Natalia Ares of the University of Oxford. Time and entropy are closely intertwined concepts. Entropy is known as the \u201c arrow of time ,\u201d because entropy tends to grow as time passes \u2014 the universe seems to consistently move from lower entropy to higher entropy ( SN: 7/10/15 ). This march toward increasing entropy explains why some processes can proceed forward in time but not in reverse: It\u2019s easy to mix cream into coffee but exceedingly difficult to separate it again. Machines also increase disorder as they operate, for example by giving off heat that boosts the entropy of their surroundings. That means even a standard, battery-powered clock produces entropy as it ticks. Physicists had previously calculated that, for tiny quantum clocks, there\u2019s a direct relationship between the maximum possible accuracy of their ticks and the amount of entropy emitted. But larger clocks are too complex for such calculations. So it wasn\u2019t clear if such a rule held for other types of clocks, too. To test how much entropy was released in the ticking of a simplified clock, Ares and colleagues made a clock from a thin membrane, tens of nanometers thick and 1.5 millimeters long, suspended across two posts. An electrical signal sent into the clock jostled the membrane, causing it to flex up and down. This bending motion repeated at regular intervals, like the steady ticks of a clock, and an antenna registered that motion. The more powerful the electrical signal was, the more accurately the clock ticked. And as the clock\u2019s accuracy increased, the entropy \u2014 a result of heat produced in the antenna\u2019s circuit \u2014 increased in lockstep. That result suggests that the theoretical relationship for quantum clocks also applies to other types of clocks. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have that,\u201d says physicist Juan Parrondo of the Complutense University of Madrid, who was not involved with the study. \u201cWhat I\u2019m not so sure of is how universal is this type of relationship that they find.\u201d The researchers studied only one variety of clock. It\u2019s not yet clear whether the relationship between accuracy and entropy applies to clocks more generally, Parrondo says. But some scientists suspect the relationship may be universal, revealing a fundamental aspect of how clocks function. The new study \u201cwould push us even more in this direction,\u201d says quantum physicist Ralph Silva of ETH Zurich, who was not involved with the research. \u201cIt\u2019s a data point in favor that it\u2019s probably the case for all clocks. But that\u2019s not been proven.\u201d In order for a clock to operate reliably, it must undergo a process that has a preferred direction in time. If the clock didn\u2019t create entropy, it would be just as likely to run forward as backward. And the more entropy the clock creates, the less likely it is that the clockwork will suffer from fluctuations \u2014 temporary backward steps that would degrade its accuracy. So if the accuracy of all clocks does come at a cost of increased entropy, that trade-off may reflect a close link between the passage of time and its measurement. "},

And, as Yasmin notes, \u201cThe more fantastical, the better.\u201d Take the anecdote that opens the book: A woman in Texas demands an Ebola vaccine for her daughter as a deadly outbreak rages a continent away in Africa in 2014. When the pediatrician tells her there is no Ebola vaccine and that her daughter faces a much greater risk from the flu, for which he can give her a vaccine, the mother storms out: \u201cFlu vaccine?!

Her book sets out to treat this malady with a dose of the virus itself: Storytelling and anecdotes that move beyond dry facts and figures to reveal pseudoscience\u2019s sticking power. Yasmin sets up her credentials in the book\u2019s opener \u2014 physician, director of the Stanford Health Communication Initiative, former epidemiologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 to build trust among readers. But, true to form, it\u2019s her anecdotes of pseudoscience in her own upbringing that linger.

The book tackles a slew of questions that have spread from the internet to dinner tables in recent years. These include: Is there lead in your lipstick? Do vaccines cause autism? Has the U.S. government banned  research about gun violence  ( SN: 5/14/16, p. 16 )? She analyzes the pseudoscientific answers that become hard to shake and reviews related research that presents the truth. The antidote is easy to swallow, thanks to Yasmin\u2019s approach. For instance: Should you eat your baby\u2019s placenta? In chapter 2\u2019s breezy three pages, Yasmin points to celebrities such as Kim Kardashian who say eating their placentas helped them with postpartum recovery. Then Yasmin quickly moves to studies that have found no medical benefits. In fact, studies point to  potential harm  from the practice, since the organ can carry feces, inflammatory cells and bacteria ( SN Online: 7/28/17 ). She pulls no punches, referring to doctors who claim to be able to cure autism as \u201ccharlatans\u201d who offer expensive, unproven and sometimes dangerous practices. Children have died, Yasmin writes, after being given Miracle Mineral Solution as an autism cure. The solution is actually industrial bleach. She rejects the  overenthusiastic prescribing of vitamin D supplements  for everything from obesity to cancer ( SN: 2/2/19, p. 16 ), showing that the evidence of a benefit isn\u2019t there, at least not yet. Some of the issues she addresses seem ludicrous on first glance, like \u201cCan a pill make racists less racist?\u201d Actress Roseanne Barr claimed that the drug Ambien made her post a racist tweet in 2018. Yasmin looks at the opposite notion, sparked by a  2012 study  that linked heart disease medications to a reduction in racial bias. She explains how the drugs affect the body and how researchers tested for racial bias. Then she shifts to the dangers of trying to medicalize racism, which is not a medical phenomenon. The book ends with a tear-out \u201cbullshit detection kit,\u201d a list of 12 useful tips to keep in mind when weighing the credibility of a headline, research study or tweet. Questions to consider include: Who is funding the person or organization making the claim? Has a claim been verified by those not affiliated with the source? She explains how to run a reverse online search on an image to determine whether it was doctored and to learn its original source. This list will be particularly relevant to those navigating through all the misinformation swirling around COVID-19. Readers will come away from this book with a deeper understanding of what research studies can and cannot say, and the effects that storytelling and celebrity have on whether someone internalizes a health claim. Some readers might prefer more background science for each question \u2014 for a book that aims to crush pseudoscience, a bibliography or at least footnotes would have been useful. But perhaps this omission is part of Yasmin\u2019s broader point. For casual readers, references and statistics miss the mark. Instead, anecdotes in easy-to-swallow doses may be just the right amount of information and storytelling needed to stop the spread of viral BS. Buy  Viral BS  from Bookshop.org.

Carlos Osorio/AP Images", "date": "May 3, 2021 at 1:27 pm", "content": "When COVID-19 cases once again began rising in the United States this spring, it may have felt like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, a repeat of the early months of the pandemic. While cases are now starting to drop in many, but not all, of the hot spots, the country is still seeing upwards of 50,000 new cases a day, and for a few days in mid-April, those numbers topped 70,000, according to the  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . This may seem more manageable than the 200,000-plus case days in December and January, but the latest numbers are comparable to the case counts during last summer\u2019s surge. This time, though, the demographics of many of the people getting sick are different: While it varies by state, they\u2019re typically younger, and remain at risk because they are not yet vaccinated. More transmissible coronavirus variants, particularly one called B.1.1.7, appear to be driving the new surge. And, as businesses continue to reopen and vaccination efforts run into low demand, public health experts worry that the same communities that have been vulnerable throughout the pandemic may be hit hard all over again. In the past year,  demographic trends among individuals infected with COVID-19  have shown that adults over the age of 65 have been more likely to die from the disease. Black residents, Hispanic/Latino residents and other minority groups, have been both more likely to get sick and more likely to face severe illness. Now, however, vaccinations are protecting a majority of seniors, while many minority communities and not-yet-vaccinated younger adults, those under age 50,  remain vulnerable to infection . And this younger crowd isn\u2019t just getting asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 cases: A greater share of those now hospitalized are younger adults compared to their share of total hospitalizations in earlier months. Nationwide, about 9,000 COVID-19 patients under age 50 were admitted to hospitals in the second week of April, compared with about 6,000 people in that age group a month earlier \u2014 while admissions for patients over age 60 have stayed at constant levels since late February.\u00a0 This trend is more pronounced in states with surging case numbers. Michigan, for example, saw about 1,000 new adult patients under age 50 admitted to the hospital with confirmed COVID-19 cases in the week ending April 9, compared with under 300 patients in that age group in the first week of 2021, during the peak of the winter surge. Those younger patients made up just 17 percent of all patients in Michigan during that earlier week, but 29 percent three months later. Vaccinations do help. Yet while younger adults reached the front of the vaccine line only in recent weeks, many eligible residents in minority communities have struggled to get a vaccine since the rollout began. Polling data show that they are  just as willing (if not more) to get vaccinated  than their white neighbors, but are having trouble getting access to shots. A majority of states, for example, have vaccinated at least  25 percent of their white populations , according to Bloomberg\u2019s vaccine tracker, but only 12 states have vaccinated the same share of their Black populations as of April 26. And only nine states have reached that milestone with Hispanic/Latino populations. These numbers are concerning, says Enrique Neblett, a health behavior expert at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and associate director of the Detroit Community-Academic Urban Research Center. Neblett has seen how access issues disrupt vaccination first-hand through his work in Detroit. \u201cThe folks on the ground [community organizers in Detroit] were saying things like, they were not seeing a lot of hesitancy, but it was more around access to the vaccine, transportation, work hours,\u201d he says. These barriers are common in already-vulnerable communities, leaving individuals living there more susceptible during this new surge, he says. That vulnerability has consequences. During the winter of 2020, racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 hospitalization rates  became less severe  compared with the earlier months of the pandemic. But Neblett says he worries that a lack of vaccine access, coupled with the longstanding differences in health care access, employment and other institutional and culture factors that caused these  COVID-19 disparities  in the first place, may revert this pattern in the coming months ( SN: 4/10/20 ). \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to say, but I do think if we don\u2019t get a handle on this, it\u2019s very likely that we could see those disparities start to increase again,\u201d he says. One reason for the rise in cases is that the coronavirus is mutating, creating variants of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus that initially seeded infections.  B.1.1.7, a variant first identified in the United Kingdom , was causing more cases in the United States than any other version of the coronavirus \u2014  an estimated 59 percent of cases  nationwide as of April 10, according to the CDC. COVID-19 vaccines currently in use in the United States are demonstrably  effective against B.1.1.7 , meaning you may be protected from severe disease even if you get sick with this variant. But B.1.1.7 is estimated to be between 40 percent to 70 percent more transmissible, so it  can spread more easily  among people who haven\u2019t yet received a vaccine ( SN: 4/19/21 ).\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s almost two pandemics happening,\u201d says Will Lee, head of science at the genomics company Helix, which has been working with the CDC to track variant cases through testing and genetic sequencing. \u201cOne of which is original SARS-CoV-2, and the other one, which is B.1.1.7.\u201d Since B.1.1.7 is so much more transmissible, Lee says, we can think of it as akin to a new disease, with its own infection patterns and outbreaks. Lee says that the United Kingdom\u2019s winter outbreak shows how B.1.1.7 cases can rise in a region even as cases caused by older variants decrease. Michigan\u2019s surge in cases is following a similar pattern. From mid-March to mid-April, B.1.1.7 made up an estimated 70 percent of cases in the state, which had identified its first case with the variant only in mid-January. And the variant is clearly having an impact: Michigan accounted for 10 percent of new COVID-19 cases nationwide the week of April 8 to 14, while the state represents only 3 percent of the nation\u2019s population. Hospitals in the state  cancelled elective surgeries  to cope with the surge of COVID-19 patients. And Michigan is not the only state with a B.1.1.7 problem: almost three in four cases in Tennessee, Minnesota and Florida are now caused by B.1.1.7, the CDC reports. Meanwhile, other parts of the country are dealing with other variants that are not as well-studied. In California, 39 percent of cases are caused by B.1.427/B.1.429, a pair of variants that are more transmissible and not as responsive to the drugs that doctors have been using to treat COVID-19. The California variants are also spreading readily in Arizona (31 percent of cases), Colorado (25 percent) and other states in the Midwest. A home-grown variant has been identified in New York City, too, and that one is causing more than 1 in 10 cases nationwide. It takes time to do the genetic testing needed to identify these variant cases \u2014 and the United States is still  struggling to scale up  its national surveillance efforts \u2014 so these data are a snapshot from mid-April. Since then, the new outbreaks from B.1.1.7 and other variants have likely grown. That said, variants aren\u2019t fully to blame for the steep rise in cases. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever any one factor that drives everything we see,\u201d says Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida in Gainesville. While B.1.1.7 and other emerging variants can speed up case increases, Dean notes, there have been other contributing factors in recent months, such as businesses reopening and behavior changes putting people in closer quarters, spurring the virus\u2019 spread. States from California to Connecticut have eased up on mask mandates, indoor capacity limits and other restrictions. Such  reopenings can drive outbreaks  in larger communities as people who get infected at a restaurant or a football game interact with others who did not choose to enter a riskier setting ( SN: 6/18/20 ). Prisons and jails are particularly  likely to cause outbreaks  in their surrounding communities, too. Many incarcerated Americans  have yet to be vaccinated  \u2014 unlike nursing home residents, another group living in close quarters. Bellamy Creek Correctional Facility, a prison in Michigan, was  a major B.1.1.7 outbreak site in February , which seeded other cases in the state. Still, amid this latest surge, there\u2019s one crucial metric that has stayed mercifully low: the death rate. The daily average for deaths has  stayed below 1,000 since mid-March . This number suggests in part that, so far, the vaccines are protecting many of the most vulnerable. But that\u2019s not enough. In order for us to control the new rise in cases, the United States will need enough people vaccinated to stop new infections. Dean considers Michigan as a warning to other states of how quickly new outbreaks may pick up, but she says it\u2019s not a foregone conclusion. \u201cEvery day that we vaccinate more people, we\u2019re making that [trajectory] less likely,\u201d she says.

New clues hint at how", "author": "Laura Sanders", "image": ["https://www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/042221_ls_covid_brain_feat-1030x580.jpg"], "image_content": "COVID-19 can come with brain-related problems, but just how the virus exerts its effects isn\u2019t clear. Roxana Wegner/Moment/Getty Images", "date": "April 27, 2021 at 6:00 am", "content": "For more than a year now, scientists have been racing to understand how the mysterious new virus that causes COVID-19 damages not only our bodies, but also our brains. Early in the pandemic, some infected people noticed a curious symptom: the loss of smell. Reports of other brain-related symptoms followed: headaches, confusion, hallucinations and delirium. Some infections were accompanied by depression, anxiety and sleep problems. Recent studies suggest that leaky blood vessels and inflammation are somehow involved in these symptoms. But many basic questions remain unanswered about the virus, which has infected more than 145 million people worldwide. Researchers are still trying to figure out how many people experience these psychiatric or neurological problems, who is most at risk, and how long such symptoms might last. And details remain unclear about how the pandemic-causing virus, called SARS-CoV-2, exerts its effects. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t established what this virus does in the brain,\u201d says Elyse Singer, a neurologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. There are probably many answers, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take us years to tease this apart.\u201d For now, some scientists are focusing on the basics, including how many people experience these sorts of brain-related problems after COVID-19. A recent study of electronic health records reported an alarming answer: In the six months after an infection,  one in three people had experienced a psychiatric or neurological diagnosis . That result, published April 6 in  Lancet Psychiatry , came from the health records of more than 236,000 COVID-19 survivors. Researchers counted diagnoses of 14 disorders, ranging from mental illnesses such as anxiety or depression to neurological events such as strokes or brain bleeds, in the six months after COVID-19 infection. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect it to be such a high number,\u201d says study coauthor Maxime Taquet of the University of Oxford in England. One in three \u201cmight sound scary,\u201d he says. But it\u2019s not clear whether the virus itself causes these disorders directly. The vast majority of those diagnoses were depression and anxiety, \u201cdisorders that are extremely common in the general population already,\u201d points out Jonathan Rogers, a psychiatrist at University College London. What\u2019s more, depression and anxiety are on the rise among everyone during the pandemic, not just people infected with the virus. Mental health disorders are \u201cextremely important things to address,\u201d says Allison Navis, a neurologist at the post-COVID clinic at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \u201cBut they\u2019re very different than a stroke or dementia,\u201d she says. About 1 in 50 people with COVID-19 had a stroke, Taquet and colleagues found. Among people with severe infections that came with delirium or other altered mental states, though, the incidence was much higher \u2014 1 in 11 had strokes. Taquet\u2019s study comes with caveats. It was a look back at diagnosis codes, often entered by hurried clinicians. Those aren\u2019t always reliable. And the study finds a relationship, but can\u2019t conclude that COVID-19 caused any of the diagnoses. Still, the results hint at how COVID-19 affects the brain.\u00a0 Early on in the pandemic, the loss of smell suggested that the virus might be able to attack nerve cells directly. Perhaps SARS-CoV-2 could breach the skull by climbing along the olfactory nerve, which carries smells from the nose directly to the brain, some researchers thought. That frightening scenario doesn\u2019t seem to happen much. Most studies so far have failed to turn up much virus in the brain, if any, says Avindra Nath, a neurologist who studies central nervous system infections at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. Nath and his colleagues expected to see signs of the virus in brains of people with COVID-19 but didn\u2019t find it. \u201cI kept telling our folks, \u2018Let\u2019s go look again,\u2019\u201d Nath says. \u00a0 That absence suggests that the virus is affecting the brain in other ways, possibly involving blood vessels. So Nath and his team scanned blood vessels in post-mortem brains of people who had been infected with the virus with an MRI machine so powerful that it\u2019s not approved for clinical use in living people. \u201cWe were able to look at the blood vessels in a way that nobody could,\u201d he says. Damage abounded , the team reported February 4 in the  New England Journal of Medicine . Small clots sat in blood vessels. The walls of some vessels were unusually thick and inflamed. And blood was leaking out of the vessels into the surrounding brain tissue. \u201cYou can see all three things happening at the same time,\u201d Nath says. Those results suggest that clots, inflamed linings and leaks in the barriers that normally keep blood and other harmful substances out of the brain may all contribute to COVID-related brain damage. But several unknowns prevent any definite conclusions about how these damaged blood vessels relate to people\u2019s symptoms or outcomes. There\u2019s not much clinical information available about the people in Nath\u2019s study. Some likely died from causes other than COVID-19, and no one knows how the virus would have affected them had they not died. Inflammation in the body can cause trouble in the brain, too, says Maura Boldrini, a psychiatrist at Columbia University in New York. Inflammatory signals released after injury can change the way the brain makes and uses chemical signaling molecules, called neurotransmitters, that help nerve cells communicate. Key communication molecules such as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine can get scrambled when there\u2019s lots of inflammation. Neural messages can get interrupted in people who suffer traumatic brain injuries, for example; researchers have found a relationship between inflammation and mental illness in football players and others who experienced hits to the head. Similar evidence comes from people with depression, says Emily Troyer, a psychiatrist at the University of California, San Diego. Some people with depression have high levels of inflammation, studies have found. \u201cWe don\u2019t actually know that that\u2019s going on in COVID,\u201d she cautions. \u201cWe just know that COVID causes inflammation, and inflammation has the potential to disrupt neurotransmission, particularly in the case of depression.\u201d Among the cells that release inflammatory proteins in the brain are microglia, the brain\u2019s version of the body\u2019s disease-fighting immune system. Microglia may also be involved in the brain\u2019s response to COVID-19.  Microglia primed for action  were found in about 43 percent of 184 COVID-19 patients, Singer and others reported in a review published February 4 in  Free Neuropatholog y. Similar results come from a series of autopsies of COVID-19 patients\u2019 brains;  34 of 41 brains contained activated microglia , researchers from Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York Presbyterian Hospital reported April 15 in  Brain . With these findings, it\u2019s not clear that SARS-CoV-2 affects people\u2019s brains differently from other viruses, says Navis. In her post\u2013COVID-19 clinic at Mount Sinai, she sees patients with fatigue, headaches, numbness and dizziness \u2014 symptoms that are known to follow other viral infections, too. \u201cI\u2019m hesitant to say this is unique to COVID,\u201d Navis says. \u201cWe\u2019re just not used to seeing so many people getting one specific infection, or knowing what the viral infection is.\u201d Teasing apart all the ways the brain can suffer amid this pandemic, and how that affects any given person, is impossible. Depression and anxiety are on the rise, surveys suggest. That rise might be especially sharp in people who endured stressful diagnoses, illnesses and isolation. Just being in an intensive care unit can lead to confusion. Delirium affected 606 of 821 people \u2014 74 percent \u2014 while patients were in intensive care units for respiratory failure and other serious emergencies, a 2013 study found. Post-traumatic stress disorder afflicted  about a third of people who had been seriously sick with COVID-19  ( SN: 3/12/21 ). More specific aspects of treatment matter too. COVID-19 patients who spent long periods of time on their stomachs might have lingering nerve pain, not because the virus attacked the nerve, but because the prone position compressed the nerves. And people might feel mentally fuzzy, not because of the virus itself, but because a shortage of the anesthetic drug, propofol, meant they received an alternative sedative that can bring more aftereffects, says Rogers, the psychiatrist at University College London. Lingering questions \u2014 what the virus actually does to the brain, who will suffer the most, and for how long \u2014 are still unanswered, and probably won\u2019t be for a long time. The varied and damaging effects of lockdowns, the imprecision doctors and patients use for describing symptoms (such as the nonmedical term \u201cbrain fog\u201d) and the indirect effects the virus can have on the brain all merge, creating a devilishly complex puzzle. For now, doctors are busy focusing on ways in which they can help, even amid these mysteries, and designing larger, longer studies to better understand the effects of the virus on the brain. That information will be key to helping people move forward. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be over soon, unfortunately,\u201d Troyer says. \u00a0 "},

The current surge in the number of cases will dip over the summer, then rise again in the winter, a health expert predicted April 22 during a  news briefing  sponsored by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Meanwhile, cases are expected to continue to rise globally, largely fueled by cases in South Asia, particularly India, said Ali Mokdad, a public health researcher at the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle. As more Americans get vaccinated, daily deaths are predicted to decline, Mokdad said, from about 700 deaths per day as of April 21 to about 200 deaths per day by August 1. By then, the  U.S. cumulative death toll from COVID-19  is expected to reach 618,000, up from about 570,000 currently. As with other respiratory viruses, when cold weather drives more people back inside, cases and deaths could surge again, Mokdad said. How bad it gets depends on whether people  wear masks  ( SN: 2/12/21 ). \u201cCome winter\u2026 we expect a rise in cases and we\u2019ll be swimming upstream,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a problem coming. Please, wear your mask.\u201d If 95 percent of people wear masks, the rise in cases and deaths could be mild, he said. Vaccines, coronavirus variants, the number of people who have already had COVID-19 and how much people interact with others could change the equation as well. Looking longer-term, the coronavirus is here to stay, Amesh Adalja, an infectious diseases doctor at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security said in the briefing. \u201cIt\u2019s a mistake to think that we\u2019re going to get to COVID-zero. This is not an eradicable disease,\u201d he said. But if enough people get vaccinated, the virus may eventually become more like a seasonal cold. \u201cThese vaccines \u2026 will change your life,\u201d Adalja said. \u201cThese vaccines were made to defang or tame the virus, and they\u2019re doing an excellent job at that.\u201d Some \u201cbreakthrough\u201d infections have happened among fully vaccinated people, but those infections tend to produce mild symptoms with few instances of serious illness or hospitalization, Adalja said.  Vaccinated people are also less likely to spread the virus to others  if they do catch it ( SN: 3/30/21 ). Even so, until herd immunity has been reached, people will still need to wear masks, Adalja said. \u00a0But, he added, \u201cthe more people we get vaccinated, the less likely we will have to think about masks again for COVID-19.\u201d "},

One such place is the  r/Coronavirus community  on the website Reddit. In January 2020, it had around 1,000 members. That number spiked to 1.5 million by March of 2020, partly due to Reddit highlighting it on their homepage  over any of the other  related subreddits. Today, the page has 2.4 million users, with around 10,000 new comments a day. The forum has become a one-stop shop for up-to-date coronavirus information, offering up pandemic news, locations of vaccination sites and how to sign up for clinical trials. The community has also hosted Q&A discussions with the likes of Bill Gates and Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as top researchers. Even Reddit CEO Steve Huffman reached out to the volunteers who moderate the forum to tell them that he starts his day by reading it and to thank them for their work. But the work these moderators do isn\u2019t easy, as the forum is also a breeding ground for misinformation. They work tirelessly to make sure the information on the subreddit is reliable, taking time away from their jobs as doctors, researchers and students. Science News  spoke to three of these moderators about what it\u2019s like to combat misinformation online during a pandemic. Head moderator Patrick Doherty is a biotech research scientist; Jennifer Cole is a biological anthropologist at Royal Holloway University of London, who studies online communities related to health and became an infodemic manager, after receiving training from a  World Health Organization initiative to fight misinformation ; and Rohan \u2014 who requested not to use his full name due to the daily harassment he receives on Reddit \u2014 is a M.D./Ph.D. student in molecular biology. Answers have been edited for clarity and length. Doherty:  I actually was recruited by one of the other moderators. At the start of the pandemic, there was a lot of really bad preprint papers that were coming out. And one that came out was about how \u2026 the coronavirus could have potentially been manufactured in a lab using an HIV strain. A [Reddit] user had posted it. So I had written a detailed comment in response, explaining why the paper was bad and why the results didn\u2019t mean anything. The paper eventually ended up getting  retracted  ( SN: 3/26/20 ). The moderators saw my comment and liked how I expressed the science, so they invited me to a be a moderator. Rohan:  I started in September 2020, the day before [then-President Donald]  Trump tested positive  ( SN: 10/5/20 ). Over the course of the previous six months of the pandemic, I had seen a lot of misinformation on the subreddit. I wanted to contribute to removing some of that stuff, and I also thought there was a lot of opportunity for the subreddit to run special projects, like motivate people to get vaccines or help them find vaccination locations. And I thought given my background, I would be able to give some help with that. Cole:  Honestly, largely no. Because I\u2019ve done this before with Ebola. There\u2019s been nothing different in this pandemic to what there was in Ebola, there\u2019s just been more of it. The scale has been different, but the kind of conspiracy theories you see and the kind of things people say are no different. Doherty:  It can be kind of soul crushing sometimes, especially when there wasn\u2019t a lot of good news. Now there\u2019s  good   news  about vaccines ( SN: 3/30/21; SN: 3/8/21 ) . But before, every day, I was opening up the sub, and every morning I would read the front page of our subreddit, and it was all just bad news. It can be a lot. Rohan:  There\u2019s an ebb and flow to how much time it takes to moderate. For example, if there\u2019s big news about a vaccine being approved, then we\u2019ll all just be spending a significant portion of the day answering user questions and combating misinformation. But just general day-to-day management, it\u2019s a pretty large team and we try to coordinate with each other. It does take a lot of collective time, and we try to make sure that if someone\u2019s having a busy day or week, then we try to help them out. Cole:  At first, instead of just removing somebody, we engage with them. If their information is wrong, we explain why it\u2019s wrong. And certainly the first time that users post something that is wrong, we will try and correct them and push them in the direction of the better information. If they keep coming back obviously trying to push a narrative, that\u2019s when we will ban them. You do need to make a distinction between people who might have heard it somewhere and don\u2019t understand it very well and need you to explain it to them a bit better, versus people who are trying to push a narrative. Sometimes we\u2019ll check on users\u2019 posting history and what else they\u2019re posting elsewhere. Doherty:  Misinformation is really hard to combat, because someone can post two sentences of made-up stuff, which takes them only five seconds. But If I want to refute that, I have to find one source, then two sources, then three sources, and a breakdown scientifically of why that\u2019s not true. I can\u2019t just say \u201cno, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d because then you\u2019re just leaving it to the reader about who they trust more. Whereas you have to go and find sources and show why you\u2019re right and that takes time. It\u2019s really easy to share a meme and get 25,000 likes and people are convinced that it\u2019s true, and it only took that person 10 seconds to make it. Doherty:  I\u2019ve never been doxed [that\u2019s when someone publishes private personal information online]. I keep my name separate from my username. I never say who I am on the subreddit. But if you delete someone\u2019s comment, I\u2019ve had someone say \u201cslit your throat\u201d or just really awful death threat sort of stuff. You can report that to Reddit, and they\u2019ll ban the user from the site for things like that, but we get a lot of stuff like that. You get used to it, but you don\u2019t really get used to it. Rohan:  Most of the nasty direct messages are just vitriol or people being nasty. That\u2019s essentially a daily occurrence. And not infrequently, but multiple times in a day. Beyond that, there\u2019s more minor threats such as \u201cOh, I\u2019ll report you\u201d or \u201cOh, soon you will be revealed and exposed as a shill.\u201d Those probably come a few times a week, more frequently if it\u2019s a busy period or particularly sensitive topic. The serious threats, like the threats of actual harm to me, are fortunately significantly rarer. Usually, it\u2019s someone saying they\u2019ll dox me or that they\u2019ll \u201cfind me\u201d and that I should kill myself. Those are unpleasant, but significantly rarer, probably on the order of a month or more in between. Cole:  I\u2019ve had attacks that I\u2019d describe as pathetic. They\u2019re not scary or frightening. But part of the ethics agreement with my university is that if I do research on these online communities, I do it under my own name so that it\u2019s transparent. My university is aware that I do this. My campus security also knows. One thing that people online do is say things like \u201cwe know where you work.\u201d But do they ever go as far as contacting the university? No, they don\u2019t. Rohan:  It\u2019s shifted from being just a place to get news about the pandemic and its response, and more of a place to get information that\u2019s actually more actionable for the users. So for example, one of our moderators put together a wonderful list of vaccine location resources from around the U.S., Canada and even around the world. And I run a piece that answers user questions on the vaccines, so I have a little write-up about what we know about vaccines. And in the comments, users can come ask questions, and I try my best within 24 hours to answer any of those questions or tell them to go talk to their doctor. Rohan:  Being able to just sit down and methodically answer vaccine questions and address concerns is probably one of my favorite parts of doing this. There was one person who was talking about how their family has some history of medical conditions, and that they are scared and didn\u2019t think they\u2019d get the vaccine. They wanted someone to explain a couple of questions to them. I remember I went back and forth with this user probably five times over the course of several hours that day. At the end of it, they told me they were going to go get the vaccine as soon as they were eligible. Doherty:  I\u2019ve really grown to like the community that I\u2019ve helped build. We\u2019ve learned a lot about what\u2019s misinformation and what\u2019s not misinformation. It\u2019s sort of a learned skill. Not that we\u2019re 100 percent perfect, but I just feel like we have a unique skillset at this point, and it\u2019d feel wrong to stop. I\u2019d feel guilty. Also, the team. The moderators have become good friends. We do Zoom hangouts and happy hours, and we joke about hanging out when this is all over. We\u2019ve become a real group of friends. "},

But even as COVID-19 cases wane, researchers are scrutinizing ones popping up in a particular group of people: those who are fully vaccinated. Such cases, called breakthrough infections, aren\u2019t unexpected. That\u2019s because the vaccines are not 100 percent effective. \u201cWhen people hear about breakthrough infections, they automatically think \u2018oh, these vaccines are not working\u2019 or \u2018they\u2019re not effective,\u2019\u201d says Richard Teran, an epidemiologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Epidemic Intelligence Service. \u201cThat is just not true \u2026 the majority of individuals who do get the vaccine are protected against COVID infection and also from severe disease.\u201d All three jabs currently authorized for use in the United States \u2014 Pfizer\u2019s, Moderna\u2019s and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s \u2014 proved effective at preventing COVID-19 symptoms in clinical trials. And evidence is building that Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s jabs, both mRNA vaccines,  thwart infection as well  in immunized people ( SN: 3/30/21 ). People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving all doses of a vaccine. But when coronavirus breakthroughs do happen, there are several important questions for experts to consider, says Francesca Torriani, an infectious diseases physician and hospital epidemiologist at the University of California, San Diego. Do the breakthrough infections cause severe disease? Or do vaccinated people tend to have milder symptoms? Another question is whether immunized people who still get infected pass the virus on to others. Lastly, did an immunized person get the infection because their immune system didn\u2019t kick into high gear after getting the shot? Or was it that the vaccine sparked an immune response that didn\u2019t offer much protection against, perhaps, a coronavirus variant? \u00a0 There has been some progress toward answering these questions since COVID-19 vaccines began making it into arms in late 2020. Here\u2019s what researchers have learned so far. Of the more than 95 million people in the United States who were fully vaccinated, only 9,245 \u2014 or 0.01 percent \u2014 have been infected with the coronavirus as of April 26, according to the CDC. Just over a quarter of those people never had symptoms; 132 people, or 1 percent of the breakthrough infections, died. Twenty of those deaths were in asymptomatic people or probably not related to COVID-19. Studies analyzing vaccinated people in the real world show that not only are breakthrough COVID-19 cases rare (at least based on analyses of the mRNA vaccines; there has been less time to study J&J\u2019s shot), they also lessen the chances of severe disease. What\u2019s more, there are hints that vaccinated people are  less likely to transmit the virus  to others ( SN: 2/12/21 ). In Chicago, for example, vaccinations helped stem the coronavirus\u2019 spread in skilled nursing facilities \u2014 which were hit hard earlier in the pandemic because of high risk of exposure and residents at risk of becoming severely ill. Among 14,765 fully vaccinated residents and staff members, only  22 people got the virus more than two weeks after their second dose  of Moderna\u2019s jab, Teran and colleagues reported in the April 30  Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report . Most of those 22 people were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, but two were hospitalized for COVID-19. One person, who had multiple underlying conditions, died. But there weren\u2019t any additional cases traced back to the breakthrough infections, suggesting that the risk of transmission from infected vaccinated people is low. More work needs to be done to get a better handle on transmission risk from vaccinated people and whether older people with underlying conditions might be more likely to have a breakthrough infection. But \u201cI think [the study] really shows that the vaccines are working,\u201d Teran says. And the shots are \u201cour most important tool for stopping COVID transmission and finally slowing down this pandemic here in the U.S.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0 The key to finding breakthrough infections is doing a lot of testing, says Torriani, who coauthored a March 23  New England Journal of Medicine  letter that described the  success of mRNA vaccines at protecting health care workers in Southern California . An infected person might not have symptoms or only mild ones, meaning cases could easily fly under the radar or be mistaken for things like the common cold. So current CDC counts are likely an underestimate. One aspect of the ongoing pandemic that experts are meticulously watching is the emergence of coronavirus variants. Some mutations in the coronavirus could help it evade immune responses in vaccinated people, who could require a booster shot to provide better protection. In Israel, for instance, people vaccinated with Pfizer\u2019s shot  may be more likely to be infected with a variant  first identified in the United Kingdom or one from South Africa compared with unvaccinated people, researchers reported April 9 in a preliminary study posted at medRxiv.org. Unvaccinated people, on the other hand, are vulnerable to all versions of the coronavirus. But the cases in vaccinated people appeared to happen in a particular time frame, says Adi Stern, an evolutionary virologist at Tel Aviv University. People who caught the version of the virus that emerged in the United Kingdom were more likely to have received only one vaccine dose, perhaps because they did not yet have full protection. Those who got two doses were more likely to get infected with the version from South Africa, but only until two weeks after the shot. After that two-week period, Stern and her colleagues didn\u2019t see breakthrough cases of the variant from South Africa. Although that variant isn\u2019t very common in Israel, which could mean such cases were simply hard to find. \u201cWhat we think happens is that immunity hasn\u2019t reached its peak, that it\u2019s on its way to reaching the peak,\u201d Stern says. \u201cThat\u2019s when we think that there\u2019s an advantage\u201d for the variant.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 In some rare cases, infections can happen even in the face of a strong immune response from a vaccine. One patient in New York, for instance, developed COVID-19 symptoms  19 days after receiving a second dose of Moderna\u2019s jab , despite having high levels of protective antibodies, researchers reported online April 21 in the  New England Journal of Medicine . The virus responsible for the infection had a mutation thought to help the coronavirus evade the immune system. But it is possible that the patient got infected before the second shot took full effect, the researchers note. Still, it\u2019s important for experts to be aware of such cases and use them to gather more information, says Ezgi Hacisuleyman, an RNA biochemist at Rockefeller University in New York City and coauthor of the study. That way if there is an uptick of cases in immunized individuals, researchers can quickly pinpoint them and determine if it\u2019s a case of a coronavirus variant skirting around a strong immune response. \u00a0 For now, there aren\u2019t enough breakthrough infections pegged to variants to merit the use of updated shots. \u201cThere are going to be [breakthrough infections] no matter what,\u201d Stern says. \u201cWe need to keep an eye on the variants, but still I think we also have to trust the vaccine itself because we have evidence: It works.\u201d "},

Getting such a glimpse could have come much sooner. In 1965, marine scientist Frederick Aldrich had proposed studying these behemoths of the abyss using  Alvin , a submersible funded by the U.S. Navy and operated by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. During the Cold War, however, studying sea life was not a top priority for the Navy, the main funder of U.S. marine research. Instead, the Navy urgently needed information about the terrain of its new theater of war and a thorough understanding of the medium through which submarines traveled. In  Science on a Mission , science historian Naomi Oreskes explores how naval funding revolutionized our understanding of earth and ocean science \u2014 especially plate tectonics and deep ocean circulation. She also investigates the repercussions of the military\u2019s influence on what we still don\u2019t know about the ocean. The book begins just before World War II, when the influx of military dollars began. Oreskes describes how major science advances germinated and weaves those accounts with deeply researched stories of backstabbing colleagues, attempted coups at oceanographic institutions and daring deep-sea adventures. The story flows into the tumult of the 1970s, when naval funding began to dry up and scientists scrambled to find new backers. Oreskes ends with oceanography\u2019s recent struggles to align its goals not with the military, but with climate science and marine biology. Each chapter could stand alone, but the book is best consumed as a web of stories about a group of people (mostly men, Oreskes notes), each of whom played a role in the history of oceanography. Oreskes uses these stories to explore the question of what difference it makes who pays for science. \u201cMany scientists would say none at all,\u201d she writes. She argues otherwise, demonstrating that naval backing led scientists to view the ocean as the Navy did \u2014 as a place where men, machines and sound travel. This perspective led oceanographers to ask questions in the context of what the Navy needed to know. One example Oreskes threads through the book is bathymetry. With the Navy\u2019s support, scientists discovered seamounts and mapped mid-ocean ridges and trenches in detail. \u201cThe Navy did not care why there were ridges and escarpments; it simply needed to know, for navigational and other purposes, where they were,\u201d she writes. But uncovering these features helped scientists move toward the idea that Earth\u2019s outer layer is divided into discrete, moving  tectonic plates  ( SN: 1/16/21, p. 16 ). Through the lens of naval necessity, scientists also learned that deep ocean waters move and mix. That was the only way to explain the thermocline, a zone of rapidly decreasing temperature that separates warm surface waters from the frigid deep ocean, which affected naval sonar. Scientists knew that acoustic transmissions depend on water density, which, in the ocean, depends on temperature and salinity. What scientists discovered was that density differences coupled with Earth\u2019s rotation drive deep ocean currents that take cold water to warm climes and vice versa, which in turn create the thermocline. Unquestionably, naval funding illuminated physical aspects of the ocean. Yet many oceanographers failed to recognize that the ocean is also an \u201cabode of life.\u201d The  Alvin \u2019s inaugural years in the 1960s focused on salvage, acoustics research and other naval needs until other funding agencies stepped in. That switch facilitated startling discoveries of hydrothermal vents and gardens of life in the pitch black of the deep ocean. As dependence on the Navy lessened, many Cold War scientists and their trainees struggled to reorient their research. For instance, their view of the ocean, largely driven by acoustics and ignorant of how sound affects marine life, led to public backlash against studies that could harm sea creatures. \u201cEvery history of science is a history both of knowledge produced and of ignorance sustained,\u201d Oreskes writes. \u201cThe impact of underwater sound on marine life,\u201d she says, \u201cwas a domain of ignorance.\u201d  Buy  Science on a Mission  from Bookshop.org.

NASA, GOES WEST", "date": "February 1, 2021 at 12:00 pm", "content": "ong the biggest questions for climate change forecasters is how atmospheric aerosols shape clouds, which can help cool the planet. Now, a new study finds that one promising strategy for understanding how aerosols and clouds interact can  overestimate the cooling ability  of pollution-generated clouds by up to 200 percent, researchers report in the Jan. 29  Science . \u201cClouds in general, and how aerosols interact with the climate, are a big uncertainty in climate models,\u201d says Franziska Glassmeier, an atmospheric scientist at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. Scientists know that aerosols \u2014 both natural, as from volcanoes, and human-caused, as from pollution \u2014 can change a cloud\u2019s thickness, ability to scatter sunlight or how much rainfall it produces. But these complicated physical effects are difficult to simulate, so scientists have sought real-world examples to study these effects. Enter ship tracks. Exhaust belched out of massive cargo ships crossing the oceans can form these bright lines of clouds. The tiny exhaust particles act as cloud nuclei: Water vapor condenses on the particles to form cloud droplets, the watery stuff of clouds. Ship tracks are \u201cthis prime example where we can see this cause and effect,\u201d Glassmeier says. \u201cPut in particles, and you can see the clouds get brighter.\u201d Brighter clouds means that they are reflecting even more sunlight back into space. Visible and measurable by satellite, the tracks offer a potential window into how larger-scale industrial pollution around the globe might be altering the planet\u2019s cloudscape \u2014 and perhaps how such clouds might affect the climate. Satellite-derived analyses of ship tracks involve measuring the density of the water droplets in the clouds from the images, and calculating how the brightness of the clouds changes over time. To assess how well ship tracks actually represent the overall impact of pollution on clouds, Glassmeier and her colleagues compared the cooling effect of ship track clouds with that of simulated pollution-derived clouds, such as might occur over a city. In particular, the researchers wanted to simulate how both the thickness and the brightness of the clouds \u2014 and therefore their cooling effect \u2014 might evolve over time, as a result of processes like rainfall and evaporation. The problem, the team found, is that the ship tracks don\u2019t tell the whole story. Ship tracks are short-lived, because the source of pollution is always on the move. But industrial pollution doesn\u2019t tend to happen in a brief pulse: Instead, there is a steady influx of particles to the atmosphere. And that difference in inputs affects how natural clouds respond over time. In both the ship track studies and the simulations of industrial pollution, clouds initially brighten and produce a cooling effect. That\u2019s because, in both cases, the addition of abundant aerosol particles to the atmosphere gives water vapor numerous surfaces on which to condense, creating many small water droplets that form this brighter cloud and reflect incoming radiation. After a few hours, however, as a ship moves on, the ship track goes away, and the pulse of pollution ceases, Glassmeier says. The initial brief bit of cooling subsides as the preexisting natural clouds return to their original, nonpolluted state. But in the case of industrial pollutants, the natural clouds don\u2019t return to their original state, the simulations show. Rather, the pollutants hasten the clouds\u2019 demise. That\u2019s because the tinier aerosol-seeded droplets begin to evaporate more quickly than larger, natural cloud droplets would. This increased evaporation thins the original cloud, allowing more heat through than if the pollutants never arrived. And that can ultimately have an overall warming, rather than cooling, effect on the climate, the team says. \u201cThere is this timescale effect that needs to be taken into account,\u201d Glassmeier says. Relying solely on ship track data to understand all sources of pollution misses this gradual thinning effect. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t throw all the ship track data away; we just need to interpret it in a new way.\u201d Current climate models tend to omit this thinning effect, she says. The new study is \u201creally useful for helping to interpret aerosol-cloud relationships in satellite data,\u201d says Edward Gryspeerdt, an atmospheric physicist at Imperial College London who was not involved in the study. It \u201cdemonstrates that the cloud response to aerosols is not instant, but evolves over time.\u201d Scientists have been aware that  ship tracks may not lead to cooling , says Graeme Stephens, an atmospheric scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. For example, Stephens notes that he and others have previously found that ship tracks can speed up cloud thinning by increasing the rate of evaporation at the tops of the clouds, while at the same time suppressing rainfall, which maintains some of the cloud\u2019s thickness. These two competing responses make determining a cloud\u2019s ultimate fate tricky. But what ship tracks can do is act as \u201ca controlled laboratory of sorts,\u201d Stephens says. They \u201coffer us a way to examine aerosol influences on clouds in a direct, concrete way.\u201d "},

The flood may have been caused by a landslide or by an overflowing glacial lake. Rishabh R. Jain/ AP Photo", "date": "February 9, 2021 at 4:32 pm", "content": " flash flood surged down a river in India\u2019s Himalayan Uttarakhand state on February 7, killing at least 30 people and washing away two hydroelectric power stations. As rescue workers search for more than 100 people who are still missing, officials and scientists are trying to unravel the causes of the sudden flood. Did a glacier high up in the mountains collapse, releasing a huge plug of frigid meltwater that spilled into the river? Or was the culprit a landslide that then triggered an avalanche? And what, if any, link might these events have to a changing climate? Here are three things to know about what might have caused the disaster in Uttarakhand. News reports in the immediate wake of the disaster suggested that the floodwaters were caused by the sudden overflow of a glacial lake high up in the mountain, an event called a glacial lake outburst flood. \u201cIt\u2019s likely too early to know what exactly happened,\u201d says Anjal Prakash, the research director of the Bharti Institute of Public Policy at the Indian School of Business in Hyderabad. Satellite images show that a section of a glacier broke off, but how that break relates to the subsequent floods is still unknown. One possibility is that the glacier was holding back a lake of meltwater, and that heavy snowfall in the region two days earlier added enough volume to the lake that the water forced its way out, breaking the glacier and surging into nearby rivers. This scenario is certainly in line with known hazards for the region. \u201cThese mountains are very fragile,\u201d says Prakash, who was also a lead author on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s 2019  special report on oceans and the cryosphere , Earth\u2019s icy places. But, he notes, there isn\u2019t yet much on-the-ground data to help clarify events. \u201cThe efforts are still focused on relief at the moment.\u201d Other researchers contend that the disaster wasn\u2019t caused by a glacial lake outburst flood at all. Instead, says Daniel Shugar, a geomorphologist at the University of Calgary in Canada, satellite images snapped during the disaster show the telltale marks of a landslide: a dark scar snaking through the white snow and clouds of dust clogging the air above. \u201cYou could see this train of dust in the valley, and that\u2019s common for a very large landslide,\u201d Shugar says. \u201cWOW,\u201d  he wrote on Twitter  the morning of February 7, posting side-by-side satellite shots of a dark area of possible \u201cmassive dust deposition,\u201d contrasted against the same snowy, pristine region just the day before. Landslides \u2014 the sudden failure of a slope, sending a rush of rocks and sediment downhill \u2014 can be triggered by anything from an earthquake to an intense deluge of rain. In high, snowy mountains, cycles of freezing and thawing and refreezing again can also begin to break the ground apart; the ice-filled cracks can slowly widen over time, setting the stage for sudden failure, and then, disaster. The satellite images seem to point clearly to such a landslide, rather than a typical glacial lake overflow, Shugar says. The force of the landslide may have actually broken off that piece of hanging glacier, he says. Another line of evidence against a sudden lake burst is that \u201cthere were no lakes of any size visible\u201d in the satellite images taken over the region. However, an outlying question for this hypothesis is where the floodwaters came from. It might be that one of the rivers draining down the mountain was briefly dammed by the rockfall; a sudden release of that dam could send a large plug of water from the river swiftly and disastrously downhill. \u201cBut that\u2019s a pure guess at the moment,\u201d Shugar says. The risk of both glacial lake outburst floods and freeze-thaw-related landslides in Asia\u2019s high mountains has increased due to climate change. At first glance, \u201cit was a climate event,\u201d Prakash says. \u201cBut the data are still coming.\u201d The region, which includes the Hindu Kush Himalayan mountains and the Tibetan Plateau, \u201chas been a climate change hot spot for a pretty long time,\u201d Prakash says. The region is often called Earth\u2019s third pole, because the stores of ice and snow in the Himalayan watershed amount to the largest reserves of freshwater outside of the polar regions. The region is the source of 10 major river systems that provide water to almost 2 billion people. Climate change reports have warned that  warming is not only threatening this water supply , but also increasing the likelihood of natural hazards ( SN: 5/29/19 ). In the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s 2019  special report on oceans and the cryosphere , scientists noted that glacier retreat, melting snow and thawing permafrost are making mountain slopes more unstable and also increasing the number of glacial lakes, upping the likelihood of a sudden, catastrophic failure ( SN: 9/25/19 ). A 2019 comprehensive assessment  focusing on climate change\u2019s impacts  in Asia\u2019s high mountains found that the glaciers in the region have retreated much more quickly in the last decade than was anticipated, Prakash says, \u201cand that is alarming for us.\u201d Here\u2019s another way to look at it:  Glaciers are retreating twice as fast  as they were at the end of the 20th century ( SN: 6/19/19 ). Glacier-related landslides in the region have also become increasingly common  in the last decade, as the region warms and destabilizing freeze-thaw cycles within the ground occur higher and higher up on the slopes. But in the case of this particular disaster, Shugar says, it\u2019s just hard to say conclusively at this point what role climate change might have played, or even what specific event might have triggered a landslide. \u201cSometimes there is no trigger; sometimes it\u2019s just time,\u201d he says. \u201cOr it\u2019s that we just don\u2019t understand the trigger.\u201d "},

The picturesque place, surrounded by sugarcane fields, is nestled in the southeast of one of the countries hit hardest by COVID-19. By the end of March, daily deaths in Brazil surged to 3,000 on average a day, a high in a pandemic that has claimed more than 405,000 lives there \u2014 the second worst death toll of any country in the world behind only the United States. And as vaccines slowly trickle into the country, only about 15 percent of the population has gotten at least one shot. Except in Serrana. There, nearly all the adults have gotten their shots. What happens next in this city could provide a glimpse of what the future of the pandemic could be \u2014 not only in Brazil but across the globe as vaccinations pick up. The  mass vaccination is an experiment  dubbed Projeto S, which will measure the real-world effectiveness of the Chinese-made CoronaVac vaccine, including how well it protects against coronavirus variants. One variant called P.1, which first emerged in the Brazilian Amazon and is now widespread throughout Brazil, shows signs of being both  more contagious and able to evade antibodies  trained to recognize the coronavirus ( SN: 4/14/21 ). Among the questions  the study  may help answer is \u201cwhether vaccinated people protect the unvaccinated, how long does their immunity last, and what variants are circulating,\u201d says Marcos Borges, project coordinator and director of the Serrana State Hospital. \u201cWe\u2019ll finally be able to observe how a large set of people respond to the vaccine in real-world conditions.\u201d Projeto S may be the best way to understand the effectiveness of vaccination against COVID-19 in the short and medium terms, says Ethel Maciel, an epidemiologist at the Federal University of Esp\u00edrito Santo. \u201cThis is especially important because we don\u2019t know when we will have most Brazilians vaccinated,\u201d says Maciel, who is not involved in the initiative. Serrana has the perfect ingredients for the Projeto S experiment. It\u2019s relatively small, with 45,600 residents, with roughly 30,000 adults. It\u2019s located near an important public health research center, University of S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s campus in nearby Ribeir\u00e3o Preto. And the virus was clearly circulating in the community. A July 2020 study \u201cshowed that 5 percent of the population carried the active virus \u2014 that is one person in 20, a very high rate,\u201d Borges says. The town\u2019s residents were eager to be vaccinated, however. When the project launched in February, the team at Instituto Butantan, a research facility and vaccine maker based in S\u00e3o Paulo state that is sponsoring the project, set a goal of vaccinating at least 80 percent of town residents over 18 years old. \u201cWe took into account that Brazil has a long tradition of good adhesion to vaccination, so we knew these 80 percent were within reach,\u201d says Borges. By April 11, 27,722 adult volunteers had gotten the first shot and almost all of them, 27,160, had gotten the second jab by the end of that month, meaning 95.7 percent of Serrana\u2019s adults were fully vaccinated. This success came even as  Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro publicly shunned vaccines  \u2014 CoronaVac in particular \u2014 on several occasions. The vaccine was developed by China-based Sinovac Biotech. It uses an inactivated, or \u201ckilled\u201d version of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, that can\u2019t cause illness, but can train the body\u2019s immune system to recognize the coronavirus so it can fight back against an encounter with the real pathogen. In a  Phase III clinical trial  with 12,600 health care workers in S\u00e3o Paulo,\u00a0 CoronaVac had an efficacy of roughly 50 percent two weeks after the second dose, researchers report in a preliminary study posted April 15 at medRxiv.org. \u00a0Fifty percent efficacy is the  threshold the U.S. Food and Drug Administration set as a baseline  for considering emergency use authorization of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States. In comparison, in clinical trials, the  Moderna  and  Pfizer  mRNA vaccines had an efficacy of around 95 percent ( SN: 11/16/20; SN: 11/18/20 ). Like Pfizer\u2019s and Moderna\u2019s vaccines, CoronaVac offers good protection against death and serious forms of COVID-19; of nine health care workers hospitalized with COVID-19, six were unvaccinated, one had had a single dose of CoronaVac and two had gotten both doses. One person \u2014an unvaccinated health care worker \u2014 died. A clinical trial is one thing. The real world is another. For instance, having immunized neighbors might make an important difference in how effective a vaccine actually is. \u201cWhat is the difference between a vaccine that has 95 percent of individual efficacy and one that has over 50 percent? You\u2019ve got to vaccinate 80 or 85 percent of people with the former to have the disease under control and must vaccinate everyone with the latter to have the same result,\u201d says Ernesto Marques, a virologist at the University of Pittsburgh. As most adults have been vaccinated in Serrana, Marques says he believes the results will show collective protection \u2014 or effectiveness \u2014 with CoronaVac, even if individual protection seems low comparatively. This is important not only to Brazil, \u201cbut to all countries adopting the vaccine, like Indonesia and Turkey. The results in Serrana will weigh immensely in COVID-19 vaccination policies wherever CoronaVac is used,\u201d he says.  Communities in other countries  are attempting something similar with other vaccines. Outcomes may show whether the impact of Serrana\u2019s mass vaccination spills beyond city limits. \u201cAround 15,000 of Serrana\u2019s 45,000 inhabitants commute large distances to work, so we\u2019ll see how it all unfolds with a highly mobile population,\u201d Borges says. Projeto S is yielding some tantalizing early results. Local media  reported  that the number of daily COVID-related infections decreased from 28 on March 20 to seven a month later. The share of cases that were severe dropped from a peak of  70 percent  this March to 10 percent in early April. During the project\u2019s vaccination from mid-February to mid-April, six immunized people died from COVID-19, according to the state government of  S\u00e3o Paulo . Of those, five had received only one dose and the other person showed symptoms shortly after receiving the second dose, which leads researchers to believe the patient was already infected at the time of the second shot. Among the unvaccinated there were 14 deaths. In the beginning of May, none of the six infirmary beds at Serrana\u2019s Santa Casa Hospital and the city\u2019s Basic Healthcare Unit are occupied, and the waiting line for beds both in infirmaries and intensive care units has zeroed. As of May 3, there is one Serrana resident in an infirmary and nine patients in an ICU, according to the Serrana Health Secretariat. Nurse Glenda de Moraes, who has worked for two decades in Serrana and is involved in the coordination of Projeto S, says that positive test results have dropped, too, \u201cto less than 20 percent [per day], way less than the 30 to 40 percent of positives we had before.\u201d Still according to the local Health Secretariat, confirmed cases peaked in January 2021, with 706 city residents infected with COVID-19. Infections then decreased in February and March (484 and 692 cases, respectively) and had a sharp drop in April, with 235 confirmed cases. All of this is clearly \u201can effect from the vaccination,\u201d Maciel says. But Borges is more cautious in relating all these changes to the mass immunization. \u201cWe are still studying it and when we have the results, we\u2019ll be able to affirm for sure if these events are related,\u201d he says. Projeto S will continue following residents for a year. The questions that tracking can answer \u2014 for instance, how long does a vaccine provide protection \u2014 are crucial to helping Brazilians, and the rest of the world, find the path out of the pandemic. Juliana Elaga, the first person to be vaccinated in Serrana, is sure this is the way out. \u201cI suffered a lot with the pandemic, and the vaccination was a really emotional moment for me. I felt truly relieved after the second jab. Even still adopting social distancing and mask-wearing, my heart is more at rest.\u201d Her 8-year-old, Petras, is a witness: \u201cMom used to wear two masks at once and rub her hands with alcohol-gel all the time. Now she seems a little more normal and not so worried all the time.\u201d "},

Data from a worldwide network of lightning sensors suggest that the  frequency of lightning strikes in the region has shot up  over the last decade, researchers report online March 22 in  Geophysical Research Letters . That may be because the Arctic, historically too cold to fuel many thunderstorms, is heating up  twice as fast  as the rest of the world ( SN: 8/2/19 ). The new analysis used observations from the World Wide Lightning Location Network, which has sensors across the globe that detect radio waves emitted by lightning bolts. Researchers tallied lightning strikes in the Arctic during the stormiest months of June, July and August from 2010 to 2020. The team counted everywhere above 65\u00b0 N latitude, which cuts through the middle of Alaska, as the Arctic. The number of lightning strikes that the detection network precisely located in the Arctic spiked from about 35,000 in 2010 to about 240,000 in 2020. Part of that uptick in detections may have resulted from the sensor network expanding from about 40 stations to more than 60 stations over the decade. And just looking at the 2010 and 2020 values alone may overstate the increase in lightning, because \u201cthere\u2019s such variability, year to year,\u201d and 2020 was a particularly stormy year, says Robert Holzworth, an atmospheric and space scientist at the University of Washington in Seattle. In estimating the increase in average annual lightning strikes, \u201cI would argue that we have really good evidence that the number of strokes in the Arctic has increased by, say, 300 percent,\u201d Holzworth says. That increase happened while global summertime temperatures rose from about 0.7 degrees Celsius above the 20th century average to about 0.9 degrees C above \u2014 hinting that global warming may create more favorable conditions for lightning in the Arctic. It makes sense that a warmer climate could generate more lightning in historically colder climes, says Sander Veraverbeke, an earth systems scientist at VU University Amsterdam who was not involved in the work. If it does, that could potentially ignite  more wildfires  ( SN: 4/11/19 ). But the apparent trend in Arctic lightning strikes should be taken with a grain of salt because it covers such a short period of time and the detection network includes few observing stations at high latitudes, Veraverbeke says. \u201cWe need more stations in the high north to really accurately monitor the lightning there.\u201d "},

Emissions of trichlorofluoromethane, or CFC-11, were supposed to taper off after the  Montreal Protocol banned CFC-11 production  in 2010 ( SN: 7/7/90 ). But 2014 to 2017 saw an unexpected bump. About half of that illegal pollution was  pegged to eastern China  ( SN: 5/22/19 ). Now, atmospheric data show that global CFC-11 emissions in 2019 were back down to the average levels seen from 2008 to 2012, and about 60 percent of that decline was due to reduced emissions in eastern China, two teams report online February 10 in  Nature .\u00a0 These findings suggest that the  hole in Earth\u2019s ozone layer  is still on track to close up within the next 50 years \u2014 rather than being delayed, as it would have been if CFC-11 emissions had remained at the levels seen from 2014 to 2017 ( SN: 12/14/16 ). One group analyzed the concentration of CFC-11, used to make insulating foams for buildings and household appliances, in the air above atmospheric monitoring stations around the globe. The team found that the world emitted about 52,000 metric tons of CFC-11 in 2019 \u2014 a major drop from the annual average of 69,000 metric tons from 2014 to 2018. The 2019 emissions were comparable to the average annual emissions from 2008 to 2012, Stephen Montzka, an atmospheric chemist at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colo., and colleagues report. The new measurements imply that there has been a significant decrease in illicit CFC-11 production within the last couple of years, the researchers say, probably thanks to more rigorous regulation enforcement in China and elsewhere. Another group confirmed that emissions from eastern China have diminished since 2018 by analyzing air samples from Hateruma, Japan, and Gosan, South Korea. The region emitted about 5,000 metric tons of CFC-11 in 2019, which was about 10,000 metric tons less than its average annual emissions from 2014 to 2017 and was similar to the 2008 to 2012 average. That analysis was led by Sunyoung Park, a geochemist at Kyungpook National University in Daegu, South Korea. The recent downturn in CFC-11 pollution shows that \u201cthe Montreal Protocol is working,\u201d says A.R. \u201cRavi\u201d Ravishankara, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins not involved in either study. When someone violates the treaty, \u201catmospheric sleuthing\u201d can uncover the culprits and spur countries to take action, he says. \u201cChina clearly took action, because you can see the result of that action in the atmosphere.\u201d\u00a0 Montzka cautions that it might not always be so easy to point the finger at rogue emitters. \u201cI think we got lucky this time,\u201d he says, because atmospheric monitoring sites in Asia were able to trace the bulk of illegal emissions to eastern China and monitor the situation over several years. Many places around the world, such as in Africa and South America, lack atmospheric monitoring stations \u2014 so it\u2019s still a mystery which countries besides China were responsible for the recent rise and fall of CFC-11 emissions.

These new data will ultimately help scientists more accurately project the fate of the glacier \u2014 how quickly it is melting and retreating inland, and how far it might be from complete collapse, the team reports April 9 in  Science Advances . \u201cWe know there\u2019s a sick patient out there, and it\u2019s not able to tell us where it hurts,\u201d says Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine who was not involved in the new study. \u201cSo this is the first diagnosis.\u201d Scientists have eyed the Florida-sized Thwaites Glacier with mounting concern for two decades. Satellite images reveal it has been retreating at an alarming rate of somewhere between 0.6 to 0.8 kilometers per year on average since 2001, prompting some to dub it the \u201cdoomsday glacier.\u201d But estimates of  how quickly the glacier is retreating , based on computer simulations, vary widely from place to place on the glacier, Rignot and other researchers reported in  Science Advances  in 2019. Such uncertainty is the biggest difficulty when it comes to  future projections of sea level rise  ( SN: 1/7/20 ). The primary culprit for the rapid retreat of Thwaites and other Antarctic glaciers is known:  Relatively warm ocean waters  sneak beneath the floating ice shelves, the fringes of the glaciers that jut out into the ocean ( SN: 9/9/20 ). This water eats away at the ice shelves\u2019 underpinnings, points where the ice is anchored to the seafloor that buttress the rest of the glacier against sliding into the sea. Scientists have used satellite data to roughly map out what lies beneath the Thwaites ice shelf. Three deep channels carved into the seafloor snake beneath a vast water-filled cavity 120 kilometers across. But without direct measurements of the chemistry and paths the water takes to reach Thwaites\u2019 underbelly, it\u2019s been impossible to know where the threatening water is really coming from, how warm it is, and where it\u2019s attacking the ice, says Anna W\u00e5hlin, a physical oceanographer at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden. In February and March 2019, W\u00e5hlin and her colleagues sent the AUV  Ran  to traverse two of the deep channels. Gliding about 50 meters above the seafloor, the AUV collected the first direct measurements of temperature, salinity and oxygen levels in the water. From those measurements, the team was able to trace the origins of different parcels of water mixing beneath Thwaites. Based on its chemical makeup, some of the warm water came from neighboring Pine Island Bay. \u201cWe were very surprised,\u201d because Pine Island Bay wasn\u2019t previously thought to be a major player in the future of Thwaites, W\u00e5hlin says. The water mass from there was near the bottom of the cavity, about 1,050 meters deep, and was both less salty than the surrounding seawater and several degrees Celsius warmer than the freezing point. That\u2019s an unstable situation, likely to create turbulence, and increasing the potential for erosion of the ice, W\u00e5hlin says. The find also suggests that what happens in Pine Island Bay doesn\u2019t necessarily stay in Pine Island Bay \u2014 and that the fate of Thwaites may be closely intertwined with that of the Pine Island Glacier, another rapidly-melting river of ice, W\u00e5hlin says. Together, the two glaciers are responsible for most of the ice and water that Antarctica is currently shedding. But while Thwaites is still pinned to the seafloor in some places, which slows its slide into the sea, those underpinnings are long gone for Pine Island, she says. In March, scientists identified  three tipping points for the precarious Pine Island glacier , thresholds it might cross as climate conditions evolve that would lead to phases of rapid, irreversible retreat. The third and final threshold, prompted by a roughly 1.2 degree Celsius increase in the temperature of ocean waters compared with current ocean temperatures, would drive the glacier to complete collapse, the team found. An upcoming expedition W\u00e5hlin and others are planning for January 2022 will use two AUVs to explore much farther into the cavity beneath Thwaites. Ideally, the AUVS will get several hundred kilometers closer to the shore, all the way to the grounding line, where the base of the glacier rests on land. \u201cThat\u2019s the key down the line,\u201d Rignot says. Observing how water masses are interacting with the glacier\u2019s grounding line will be crucial to understanding the future of the glacier, he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the place where melting makes the most difference to the glacier\u2019s stability.\u201d And there\u2019s a lot that researchers still don\u2019t know about the vast water cavity beneath Thwaites ice shelf, including its precise dimensions and the best places for AUVs to explore, he adds. \u201cWe are only just at the beginning.\u201d "},

The locations of Earth\u2019s geographic poles, where the planet\u2019s axis pierces the surface, aren\u2019t fixed. Instead, they wander in seasonal and  near-annual cycles , largely driven by weather patterns and ocean currents ( SN: 4/15/03 ). But in addition to moving about in relatively tight swirls just a few meters across, the poles drift over time as the planet\u2019s weight distribution shifts and alters its rotation around its axis. Before the mid-1990s, the North Pole had been drifting toward the western edge of Canada\u2019s Ellesmere Island. But then the pole veered eastward by about 71 degrees toward the northeastern tip of Greenland. It\u2019s continued to head that way, moving about 10 centimeters per year. Scientists aren\u2019t quite sure why this shift occurred, says Suxia Liu, a hydrologist at the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research in Beijing. Liu and colleagues checked how well the polar drift trends matched data from previous studies on glacial melt worldwide. In particular, glacier melt in Alaska,  Greenland  and the southern Andes accelerated in the 1990s ( SN: 9/30/20 ). The timing of that melting, as well as the effects it would have had on Earth\u2019s mass distribution, suggests that glacial melt induced by climate change helped trigger the change in polar drift, the team reports in the April 16  Geophysical Research Letters . The team\u2019s analysis shows that while glacier melting can account for much of the change in polar drift, it doesn\u2019t explain all of it. So other factors must be at play. With  copious irrigation , for example, groundwater pumped from aquifers in one region can end up in an ocean far away ( SN: 10/9/19 ). Like glacial melt, water management alone can\u2019t explain the North Pole\u2019s tack, the team reports, but it can give the Earth\u2019s axis a substantial nudge. The findings \u201creveal how much human activity can have an impact on changes to the mass of water stored on land,\u201d says Vincent Humphrey, a climate scientist at the University of Zurich not involved in this study. And they show how large these mass shifts can be, he says. \u201cThey\u2019re so big that they can change the axis of the Earth.\u201d "},

These results, based on statistical comparisons of hand bones from fossil hominids and present-day primates, stoke an ongoing debate not only  about how Ardi moved  ( SN: 2/22/19 ) but also what  the last common ancestor of humans and chimps  looked like ( SN: 12/31/09 ). \u201cThe last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees was more similar to chimps than to any other living primate,\u201d says paleoanthropologist Thomas Prang of Texas A&M University in College Station. That ancestor, who lived roughly 7 million years ago, had hands designed much like those of tree-adept, knuckle-walking chimps and bonobos, he and his colleagues say. That hand design  was retained by early hominids  such as Ardi\u2019s East African species,  Ardipithecus ramidus , the team reports February 24 in  Science Advances . Hand fossils showing a more humanlike design and grip first appeared in a later hominid,  Australopithecus afarensis , Prang\u2019s group reports. That fossil species, best known for Lucy\u2019s partial skeleton, inhabited East Africa from around 3.9 million to 3 million years ago. Not until after Lucy\u2019s kind had died out did  bonobos  diverge into a species apart from chimps, between 1.6 million and 2 million years ago ( SN: 10/27/16 ). That makes the older chimp lineage a closer relative of early hominids. Still, Prang cautions, chimps have evolved over the past several million years and don\u2019t represent \u201cliving fossils\u201d that can be used as stand-ins for the ancient ancestor of humans and chimps. To assess which species possessed especially similar hands, Prang\u2019s team analyzed the sizes and dimensions of four fossils from Ardi\u2019s hands. The researchers then compared those measurements with comparable ones from other fossil hominids and from living primates. Using the same statistical approach, Prang has previously argued that  Ar. ramidus  had  a foot that most closely resembles those of present-day chimps and gorillas . If so, then Ardi and her compatriots, who were close in size to chimps, most likely split their time between walking on all fours and moving through trees, he argued April 2019 in  eLife . In stark contrast to Prang\u2019s conclusions, paleoanthropologists who discovered and studied Ardi\u2019s remains contend that  Ar. ramidus  was built neither like chimps nor humans  ( SN: 9/9/15 ). Ardi\u2019s finger bones look like those of chimps in some ways, says Morgan Chaney of Kent State University in Ohio. Chaney works with Kent State\u2019s Owen Lovejoy, one of the scientists who originally studied Ardi\u2019s remains. But the fossil female\u2019s palm and forearm were much shorter than those of chimps, Chaney says. Combined with her distinctive wrists, her arms would have allowed only for grasping branches while moving slowly in trees. Ardi\u2019s forearm structure was not that of a knuckle-walker, Chaney contends. Prang\u2019s earlier analysis of Ardi\u2019s feet also  falls short of demonstrating a chimplike design , Chaney and colleagues argue January 10 in the  Journal of Human Evolution . Ardi\u2019s relatively long mid-foot, which is ill-suited to climbing, was not accounted for in Prang\u2019s statistical analysis, the scientists say. Similarities in body mass between Ardi and chimps, rather than a close evolutionary relationship, at least partly explain the chimplike foot measurements that Prang cites. Based on her overall body design, Ardi walked upright, Chaney and colleagues argue. She combined a long lower pelvis that stabilized a straight-legged stance with an apelike, opposable big toe. Ardi climbed trees cautiously and rarely hung or swung from branches, those researchers hold. "},

New illustrations show what\u2019s currently known about the environment inhabited periodically by Neandertals in Iberia, or what\u2019s now Spain and Portugal, from at least 350,000 years ago to nearly 100,000 years ago. Paleoartist Gabriela Amor\u00f3s Seller of the University of Murcia in Spain, used colored pencils to illustrate an idyllic view of a Neandertal man and child lounging on flat ground downslope from Bolomor Cave, near the Mediterranean coast of what\u2019s now eastern Spain. Excavations in the cave have produced evidence of the  trees, plants and animals shown in the drawing , presented in the March 15  Quaternary Science Reviews . Amor\u00f3s Seller also illustrated Bolomor Cave\u2019s Neandertal-era entrance and surrounding greenery. She and her colleagues regard these scientifically informed drawings as more than simply appealing to the eye. Art that shows the basic makeup of an ancient environment can inspire scientists to ask new questions. For instance, her group now wants to explore how ancient Iberian plants grew in the wild and what they looked like before being modified over the past few thousand years by farming practices. \u00a0 Bolomor Cave Neandertals probably ate fruit, nuts and seeds of plants that once grew in the area, says coauthor Jos\u00e9 Carri\u00f3n, an evolutionary biologist and botanist at the University of Murcia. Those plants included hazel shrubs, one of which appears just behind the Neandertal male, who is munching on a hazelnut. Strawberry trees, Mediterranean hackberry, myrtle shrubs, carob trees and chestnut trees \u2014 all shown in the drawings \u2014 were also available, he says. Insights about local plant life during Neandertal times come largely from  pollen grains and spores found in sediment layers  in Bolomor Cave, previously reported by coauthor Juan Ochando, an evolutionary botanist also at the University of Murcia, and colleagues. These layers have also yielded remains of fire pits, burned animal bones, scorched tortoise shells and four Neandertal fossils \u2014 a piece of a leg bone, two teeth and part of a braincase. The animal remains inform other parts of the drawings, such as the Neandertal child watching a tortoise inch its way forward. Tortoises were cooked and eaten at Bolomor Cave, along with frequent prey such as hares, rabbits, birds and deer. People also occasionally consumed large animals such as horses and hippos. Neandertals most likely responded to relatively mild Iberian temperatures by wearing few or no clothes, the researchers suspect. Whether they were a separate  Homo  species or an ancient variant of  Homo sapiens , Neandertals had a largely unappreciated talent  for finding and exploiting resource-rich parts of Iberia  ( SN: 3/26/20 ). Amor\u00f3s Seller\u2019s paintings vividly show some of that mammoth-free bounty. "},

Dave Lee", "date": "March 24, 2021 at 9:00 pm", "content": "Fraudulent efforts to tweak legal documents in Great Britain may have been thwarted by the very parchment those documents were written on, a new study suggests. Previous studies have shown that property deeds were written on a range of animal skins, such as goat, calf and sheep. But it turns out  sheepskin was the parchment of choice , researchers report March 24 in  Heritage Science .\u00a0 An analysis of proteins extracted from 645 samples from 477 British legal documents dating from the 16th to the 20th century shows that 622, or 96.4 percent, were made of sheepskin. That popularity may be tied to low cost compared with other parchments, like vellum made from calfskin, as well as sheepskin\u2019s fraud-busting powers. To make parchment out of animal skin, the skins are submerged in lime, a white powdery caustic soda, which removes the fat. Sheepskin has more fat \u2014 accounting for 30 to 50 percent of its weight \u2014 than other animal skins. (Cattle skin, for instance, is 2 to 3 percent fat.) So its removal leaves bigger gaps between the skin\u2019s other layers. Scraping ink from this parchment can detach these loose layers, marring the surface and revealing changes to it. \u00a0\u201cWe know so little about these documents, despite the fact that there are millions worldwide,\u201d says study coauthor Sean Doherty, an archaeologist at the University of Exeter in England. Studies like these, Doherty says, \u201care transforming libraries into biomolecular archives,\u201d which are allowing researchers to better understand animals, craft and trade over the past millennia. Several 12th and 17th century documents describe sheepskin as useful in detecting changes to an original document, such as tampering with a property owner\u2019s name. The new study adds to evidence that sheepskin helped to prevent fraudsters from pulling the wool over English officials\u2019 eyes. "},

Silas Baisch/Unsplash", "date": "September 17, 2020 at 2:00 pm", "content": "Sound waves traveling thousands of kilometers through the ocean may help scientists monitor climate change. As greenhouse gas emissions warm the planet, the ocean is absorbing vast amounts of that heat. To monitor the change, a global fleet of about 4,000 devices called Argo floats is collecting temperature data from the ocean\u2019s upper 2,000 meters. But that data collection is scanty in some regions, including deeper reaches of the ocean and areas under sea ice. So Wenbo Wu, a seismologist at Caltech, and colleagues are resurfacing a decades-old idea: using the speed of sound in seawater to estimate ocean temperatures. In a new study, Wu\u2019s team developed and tested a way to use earthquake-generated sound waves traveling across the East Indian Ocean to estimate temperature changes in those waters from 2005 to 2016. Comparing that data with similar information from Argo floats and computer models showed that the new results matched well. That finding suggests that  the technique, dubbed seismic ocean thermometry, holds promise  for tracking the impact of climate change on less well-studied ocean regions, the researchers report in the Sept. 18  Science . Sound waves are carried through water by the vibration of water molecules, and at higher temperatures, those molecules vibrate more easily. As a result, the waves travel a bit faster when the water is warmer. But those changes are so small that, to be measurable, researchers need to track the waves over very long distances. Fortunately, sound waves can travel great distances through the ocean, thanks to a curious phenomenon known as the SOFAR Channel, short for Sound Fixing and Ranging. Formed by different salinity and temperature layers within the water, the SOFAR channel is a horizontal layer that acts as a wave guide, guiding sound waves in much the same way that optical fibers guide light waves, Wu says. The waves bounce back and forth against the upper and lower boundaries of the channel, but can continue on their way, virtually unaltered, for  tens of thousands of kilometers  ( SN: 7/16/60 ). In 1979, physical oceanographers  Walter Munk , then at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif., and Carl Wunsch, now an emeritus professor at both MIT and Harvard University, came up with a plan to use these ocean properties to measure water temperatures from surface to seafloor, a technique they called \u201c ocean acoustic tomography .\u201d They would  transmit sound signals through the SOFAR Channel  and measure the time that it took for the waves to arrive at receivers located 10,000 kilometers away. In this way, the researchers hoped to compile a global database of ocean temperatures ( SN: 1/26/1991 ). But  environmental groups lobbied against and ultimately halted the experiment , stating that the human-made signals might have adverse effects on marine mammals, as Wunsch notes in a commentary in the same issue of  Science . Forty years later, scientists have determined that the ocean is in fact a very noisy place, and that the proposed human-made signals would have been faint compared with the rumbles of quakes, the belches of undersea volcanoes and the groans of colliding icebergs, says seismologist Emile Okal of Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., who was not involved in the new study. Still, Wu and colleagues have devised a work-around that sidesteps any environmental concerns: Rather than use human-made signals, they employ earthquakes. When an undersea earthquake rumbles, it releases energy as seismic waves known as P waves and S waves that vibrate through the seafloor. Some of that energy enters the water, and when it does, the seismic waves slow down, becoming T waves. Those T waves can also travel along the SOFAR Channel. So, to track changes in ocean temperature, Wu and colleagues identified \u201crepeaters\u201d \u2014 earthquakes that the team determined to originate from the same location, but occurring at different times. The East Indian Ocean, Wu says, was chosen for this proof-of-concept study largely because it\u2019s very seismically active, offering an abundance of such earthquakes. After identifying over 2,000 repeaters from 2005 to 2016, the team then measured differences in the sound waves\u2019 travel time across the East Indian Ocean, a span of some 3,000 kilometers.\u00a0 The data revealed a slight warming trend in the waters, of about 0.044 degrees Celsius per decade. That trend is similar to, though a bit faster than, the one indicated by real-time temperatures collected by Argo floats. Wu says the team next plans to test the technique with receivers that are farther away, including off of Australia\u2019s west coast. That extra distance will be important to prove that the new method works, Okal says. \u201cIt\u2019s a fascinating study,\u201d he says, but the distances involved are very short as far as T waves go, and the temperature changes being estimated are very small. That means that any uncertainty in matching the precise origins of two repeater quakes could translate to uncertainty in the travel times, and thus the temperature changes. But future studies over greater distances could help mitigate this concern, he says. The new study is \u201creally breaking new ground,\u201d says Frederik Simons, a geophysicist at Princeton University, who was not involved in the research. \u201cThey\u2019ve really worked out a good way to tease out very subtle, slow temporal changes. It\u2019s technically really savvy.\u201d And, Simons adds, in many locations seismic records are decades older than the temperature records collected by Argo floats. That means that scientists may be able to use seismic ocean thermometry to come up with new estimates of past ocean temperatures. \u201cThe hunt will be on for high-quality archival records.\u201d "},

That collapse of the Laurentide ice sheet, which at one point covered large swaths of Canada and parts of the United States, ultimately led to  major disturbances  in the global climate ( SN: 11/5/12 ). The new findings cast doubt on the long-held assumption that hemispheric-scale changes in Earth\u2019s climate originate in  the North Atlantic  ( SN: 1/31/19 ). The study suggests that the melting of Alaska\u2019s remaining glaciers into the North Pacific, though less extreme than purges of the past, could have far-ranging effects on global ocean circulation and the climate in coming centuries. \u201cPeople typically think that the Atlantic is where all the action is, and everything else follows,\u201d says Alan Mix, a paleoclimatologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis. \u201cWe\u2019re saying it\u2019s the other way around.\u201d The Cordilleran ice sheet fails earlier in the chain of reaction, \u201cand then that signal is transmitted [from the Pacific] around the world like falling dominoes.\u201d In 2013, Mix and colleagues pulled sediment cores from the seafloor of the Gulf of Alaska in the hope of figuring out how exactly the Cordilleran ice sheet had changed prior to the end of the last ice age. These cores contained distinct layers of sand and silt deposited by the ice sheet\u2019s calved icebergs during four separate occasions over the last 42,000 years. The team then used radiocarbon dating to determine the chronology of events, finding that the Cordilleran\u2019s ice purges \u201csurprisingly\u201d preceded the Laurentide\u2019s periods of abrupt ice loss, known as \u201cHeinrich events,\u201d by 1,000 to 1,500 years every single time. \u201cWe\u2019ve long known that these Heinrich events are a big deal,\u201d says coauthor Maureen Walczak, a paleoceanographer also at Oregon State University. \u201cThey have global climate consequences associated with increases in atmospheric CO 2 , warming in Antarctica \u2026 and the weakening of the Asian monsoon in the Pacific. But we\u2019ve not known why they happened.\u201d \u00a0 Though scientists can now point the finger at the North Pacific, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Mix proposes several theories for how Cordilleran ice loss ultimately translated to mass calving of ice along North America\u2019s east coast. It\u2019s possible, he says, that the freshwater deposited in the North Pacific traveled northward through the Bering Strait, across the Arctic and down into the North Atlantic. There, the buoyant freshwater served as a \u201ccap\u201d on the ocean\u2019s denser saltwater, preventing it from overturning. This process could have led to the water getting warmer, destabilizing the adjacent ice sheet. Another theory posits that the lower elevation of the diminished Cordilleran ice sheet altered how surface winds entered North America. Normally, the ice sheet would act like a fence, diverting winds and their water vapor southward as they entered North America. Without this barrier, the transport of heat and freshwater between the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins is disrupted, changing the salinity of the Atlantic waters and ultimately delivering more heat to the ice there. Today, Alaska\u2019s glaciers serve as the last remnants of the Cordilleran ice sheet. Many are in a state of rapid retreat due to climate change. This melting ice, too, drains into the Pacific and Arctic oceans, raising sea levels and interfering with normal ocean mixing processes. \u201cKnowing the failure of ice in the North Pacific seemed to presage really rapid ice loss in the North Atlantic, that\u2019s kind of concerning,\u201d Walczak says. If the ice melt into the North Pacific follows similar patterns to the past, it could yield significant global climate events, the researchers suggest. But Mix cautions that the amount of freshwater runoff needed to trigger changes elsewhere in the global ocean, and climate, is unknown. \u201cWe know enough to say that such things happened in the past, ergo, they are real and could happen again.\u201d It\u2019s not clear, though, what the timing of such global changes would be. If the ice losses in the Atlantic occurred in the past due to a change in deep ocean dynamics triggered by Pacific melting, that signal would likely take hundreds of years to reach the other remaining ice sheets. If, however, those losses were triggered by a change in sea levels or winds, other ice sheets could be affected a bit faster, though still not this century. The Laurentide ice sheet is, of course, long gone. But two others remain, in  Greenland  and  Antarctica  ( SN: 9/30/20, 9/23/20 ). Both have numerous glaciers that terminate in the ocean and drain the interior of the ice sheets. This makes the ice sheets susceptible to both warmer ocean water and sea level rise. Alaska\u2019s melting glaciers have already fueled about 30 percent of global sea level rise. \u201cOne of the hypotheses we have is that sea level rise is going to destabilize the ice shelves at the mouths of those glaciers, which will break off like champagne corks,\u201d Walczak explains. When that happens, the idea goes, the ice sheets will start collapsing faster and faster. Records of climate change in the Pacific, like the one Walczak and colleagues have compiled, have been hard to come by, says Richard Alley, a glaciologist at Pennsylvania State University who wasn\u2019t involved with the study. \u201cThese new data may raise more questions than they answer,\u201d he says. \u201cBut by linking North Pacific Ocean circulation \u2026 to the global template of climate oscillations, the new paper gives us a real advance in understanding all of this.\u201d "},

Thermometers moored at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean  recorded an average temperature increase of about 0.02 degrees Celsius  over the last decade, researchers report in the Sept. 28  Geophysical Research Letters . That warming may be a consequence of human-driven climate change, which has  boosted ocean temperatures  near the surface ( SN: 9/25/19 ), but it\u2019s unclear since so little is known about the deepest, darkest parts of the ocean. \u201cThe deep ocean, below about 2,000 meters, is not very well observed,\u201d says Chris Meinen, an oceanographer at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Miami. The deep sea is so hard to reach that the temperature at any given research site is typically taken only once per decade. But Meinen\u2019s team measured temperatures hourly from 2009 to 2019 using seafloor sensors at four spots in the Argentine Basin, off the coast of Uruguay. Temperature records for the two deepest spots revealed a clear trend of warming over that decade. Waters 4,540 meters below the surface warmed from an average 0.209\u00b0 C to 0.234\u00b0 C, while waters 4,757 meters down went from about 0.232\u00b0C to 0.248\u00b0C. This warming is much weaker than in the upper ocean, Meinen says, but he also notes that since warm water rises, it would take a lot of heat to generate even this little bit of warming so deep. It\u2019s too soon to judge whether human activity or natural variation is the cause, Meinen says. Continuing to monitor these sites and comparing the records with data from devices in other ocean basins may help to clarify matters. "},

On November 9, a tropical disturbance brewing in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean gained enough strength to become a subtropical storm. With that, Theta became the year\u2019s 29th named storm, topping the 28 that formed in 2005. With maximum sustained winds near 110 kilometers per hour as of November 10, Theta is expected to churn over the open ocean for several days. It\u2019s too early to predict Theta\u2019s ultimate strength and trajectory, but forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration say they expect the storm to weaken later in the week. If so, like most of the storms this year, Theta likely won\u2019t become a major hurricane. That track record might be the most surprising thing about this season \u2014 there\u2019s been a record-breaking number of storms, but overall they\u2019ve been relatively weak. Only five \u2014 Laura, Teddy, Delta, Epsilon and Eta \u2014 have become major hurricanes with winds topping 178 kilometers per hour, although only Laura and Eta made landfall near the peak of their strength as Category 4 storms. Even so, the 2020 hurricane season started fast, with the first nine storms  arriving earlier than ever before  ( SN: 9/7/20 ). And the season has turned out to be the most active since naming began in 1953, thanks to warmer-than-usual water in the Atlantic and the arrival of  La Ni\u00f1a, a regularly-occurring period of cooling in the Pacific , which affects winds in the Atlantic and helps hurricanes form ( SN: 9/21/19 ). If a swirling storm reaches wind speeds of 63 kilometers per hour, it gets a name from a list of 21 predetermined names. When that list runs out, the storm gets a Greek letter. While the wind patterns and warm Atlantic water temperatures set the stage for the string of storms, it\u2019s unclear if climate change is playing a role in the number of storms. As the climate warms, though, you would expect to see more of the destructive, high-category storms, says Kerry Emanuel, an atmospheric scientist at MIT. \u201cAnd this year is not a poster child for that.\u201d So far, no storm in 2020 has been stronger than a Category 4. The 2005 season  had multiple Category 5 storms , including Hurricane Katrina ( SN: 12/20/05 ). There\u2019s a lot amount of energy in the ocean and atmosphere this year, including the unusually warm water, says Emanuel. \u201cThe fuel supply could make a much stronger storm than we\u2019ve seen,\u201d says Emanuel, \u201cso the question is: What prevents a lot of storms from living up to their potential?\u201d A major factor is wind shear, a change in the speed or direction of wind at different altitudes. Wind shear \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem to have stopped a lot of storms from forming this year,\u201d Emanuel says, \u201cbut it inhibits them from getting too intense.\u201d Hurricanes can also create their own wind shear, so when multiple hurricanes form in close proximity, they can weaken each other, Emanuel says. And at times this year, several storms did occupy the Atlantic simultaneously \u2014 on September 14, five storms swirled at once. It\u2019s not clear if seeing hurricane season run into the Greek alphabet is a \u201cnew normal,\u201d says Emanuel. The historical record, especially before the 1950s is spotty, he says, so it\u2019s hard to put this year\u2019s record-setting season into context. It\u2019s possible that there were just as many storms before naming began in the \u201850s, but that only the big, destructive ones were recorded or noticed. Now, of course, forecasters have the technology to detect all of them, \u201cso I wouldn\u2019t get too bent out of shape about this season,\u201d Emanuel says. Some experts are hesitant to even use the term \u201cnew normal.\u201d \u201cPeople talk about the \u2018new normal,\u2019 and I don\u2019t think that is a good phrase,\u201d says James Done, an atmospheric scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. \u201cIt implies some new stable state.

Archaeological sites on six of these isles \u2014 part of a 1,200-kilometer-long chain \u2014 indicate that migrations to the islands occurred 35,000 to 30,000 years ago, both from the south via Taiwan and from the north via the Japanese island of Kyushu. But whether ancient humans navigated there on purpose or drifted there by accident on the Kuroshio ocean current, one of the world\u2019s largest and strongest currents, is unclear. The answer to that question could shed light on the proficiency of these Stone Age humans as mariners and their mental capabilities overall. Now, satellite-tracked buoys that simulated wayward rafts suggest that there\u2019s little chance that the seafarers reached the isles by accident. Researchers analyzed 138 buoys that were released near or passed by Taiwan and the Philippine island Luzon from 1989 to 2017, deployed as part of the  Global Drifter Program  to map surface ocean currents worldwide. In findings published online December 3 in  Scientific Reports , the team found that  only four of the buoys came within 20 kilometers  of any of the Ryukyu Islands, and these did so only as a result of typhoons and other adverse weather. It is unlikely that ancient mariners would have set out on an ocean voyage with a major storm on the horizon, say paleoanthropologist Yousuke Kaifu of the University of Tokyo and colleagues. As a result, the new findings indicate that the Kuroshio current would have forced drifters away from rather than toward the Ryukyu Islands, suggesting that anyone who made the crossing did so intentionally instead of accidentally, Kaifu says. Geologic records suggest that currents in the region have remained stable for at least the past 100,000 years. So it\u2019s reasonable to conclude that these buoys mimic how well ancient watercraft set adrift in the same area might have fared, the researchers say. \u201cFrom a navigation perspective, crossing to the Ryukyus was so challenging that accidental-drift models are unlikely to provide an effective explanation,\u201d agrees archaeologist Thomas Leppard of Florida State University in Tallahassee, who was not involved in the research. This new work \u201cis, of course, not conclusive, but it is suggestive.\u201d Stone tools and butchered remains of a rhinoceros suggest archaic human lineages such as  Homo erectus  may have similarly crossed seas at least  709,000 years ago . And artifacts found in Australia suggest modern humans may have begun voyaging across the ocean  at least 65,000 years ago  ( SN: 7/19/17 ). But it remains hotly debated whether humans\u2019 ocean journeys during the Paleolithic, which lasted from roughly 2.6 million years ago to about 11,700 years ago, were generally made accidentally or intentionally. Other data do suggest that ancient humans could have deliberately made the voyage to the Ryukyu Islands. In 2019, a team of adventurers succeeded in paddling more than 200 kilometers from Taiwan to Yonaguni in the archipelago using  a dugout canoe  that Kaifu and his colleagues made using stone axes modeled off Japanese Paleolithic artifacts.

As the pH of the ocean decreases as a result of climate change,  some bioluminescent organisms might get brighter , while others see their lights dim, scientists report January 2 at the virtual annual meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology. Bioluminescence is  de rigueur in parts of the ocean  ( SN: 5/19/20 ). The ability to light the dark has evolved more than 90 times in different species. As a result, the chemical structures that create bioluminescence vary wildly \u2014 from single chains of atoms to massive ringed complexes. With such variability, changes in pH  could have unpredictable effects  on creatures\u2019 ability to glow ( SN: 7/6/10 ). If fossil fuel emissions continue as they are, average ocean pH is expected to  drop  from 8.1 to 7.7 by 2100. To find out how bioluminescence might be affected by that decrease, sensory biologist Tom Iwanicki and colleagues at the University of Hawaii at Manoa gathered 49 studies on bioluminescence across nine different phyla. The team then analyzed data from those studies to see how the brightness of the creatures\u2019 bioluminescent compounds varied at pH levels from 8.1 to 7.7. As pH drops, the bioluminescent chemicals in some species, such as the sea pansy ( Renilla reniformis ), increase light production twofold, the data showed. Other compounds, such as those in the sea firefly ( Vargula hilgendorfii ), have modest increases of only about 20 percent. And some species, like the firefly squid ( Watasenia scintillans ), actually appear to have a 70 percent decrease in light production. For the sea firefly \u2014 which uses glowing trails to attract mates \u2014 a small increase could give it a sexy advantage. But for the firefly squid \u2014 which also uses luminescence for communication \u2014 low pH and less light might not be a good thing. Because the work was an analysis of previously published research, \u201cI\u2019m interpreting this as a first step, not a definitive result,\u201d says Karen Chan, a marine biologist at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania who wasn\u2019t involved in the study. It \u201cprovides [a] testable hypothesis that we should \u2026 look into.\u201d The next step is definitely testing, Iwanicki agrees. Most of the analyzed studies took the luminescing chemicals out of an organism to test them. Finding out how the compounds function in creatures in the ocean will be key. \u201cThroughout our oceans,  upward of 75 percent  of visible critters are capable of bioluminescence,\u201d Iwanicki says. \u201cWhen we\u2019re wholescale changing the conditions in which they can use that [ability] \u2026 that\u2019ll have a world of impacts.\u201d "},

Water temperature measurements from around the globe indicate that the total amount of heat stored in the upper oceans in 2020  was higher than any other year on record dating back to 1955 , researchers report online January 13 in  Advances in Atmospheric Sciences . Tracking ocean temperature is important because warmer water  melts more ice off the edges of Greenland and Antarctica , which raises sea levels ( SN: 4/30/20 ), and  supercharges tropical storms  ( SN: 11/11/20 ). Researchers estimated the total heat energy stored in the upper 2,000 meters of Earth\u2019s oceans using temperature data from moored sensors,  drifting probes called Argo floats , underwater robots and other instruments ( SN: 5/19/10 ). The team found that upper ocean waters contained 234 sextillion, or 10 21 , joules more heat energy in 2020 than the annual average from 1981 to 2010. Heat energy storage was up about 20 sextillion joules from 2019 \u2014 suggesting that in 2020, Earth\u2019s oceans absorbed about enough heat to boil 1.3 billion kettles of water. This analysis may overestimate how much the oceans warmed last year, says study coauthor Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist with the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research who is currently based in Auckland, New Zealand. So the researchers also crunched ocean temperature data using a second, more conservative method for estimating total annual ocean heat and found that the jump from 2019 to 2020 could be as low as 1 sextillion joules.

As part of a 20-plus-years project, researchers and volunteers spread more than 70 million eelgrass seeds over plots covering more than 200 hectares, just beyond the wide expanses of salt marsh off the southern end of Virginia\u2019s Eastern Shore. Long-term monitoring of the restored seagrass beds reveals a remarkably hardy ecosystem that is trapping carbon and nitrogen that would otherwise contribute to global warming and pollution, the team reports October 7 in  Science Advances.  That success provides a glimmer of hope for the climate and for ecosystems, the researchers say . The project, led by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and The Nature Conservancy, has now grown to cover 3,612 hectares \u2014 and counting \u2014 in new seagrass beds. By comparison, the  largest such project in Australia  aims to restore 10 hectares of seagrass. The results are \u201ca game changer,\u201d says Carlos Duarte. \u201cIt\u2019s an exemplar of how nature-based solutions can help mitigate climate change,\u201d he says. The marine ecologist at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Thuwal, Saudi Arabia is a leader in recognizing the carbon-storing capacity of mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses. The team in Virginia started with a blank slate, says Robert Orth, a marine biologist at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in Gloucester Point. The seagrass in these inshore lagoons had been wiped out by disease and a hurricane in the early 1930s, but the water was still clear enough to transmit the sunlight plants require. Within the first 10 years of restoration, Orth and colleagues witnessed an ecosystem rebounding rapidly across almost every indicator of ecosystem health \u2014 seagrass coverage,  water quality , carbon and nitrogen storage, and invertebrate and fish biomass ( SN: 2/16/17 ). For instance, the team monitored how much carbon and nitrogen the meadows were capturing from the environment and storing in the sediment as seagrass coverage expanded. It found that meadows in place for nine or more years stored, on average, 1.3 times more carbon and 2.2 times more nitrogen than younger plots, suggesting that storage capacity increases as meadows mature. Within 20 years, the restored plots were accumulating carbon and nitrogen at rates similar to what natural, undisturbed seagrass beds in the same location would have stored. The restored seagrass beds are now sequestering on average about 3,000 metric tons of carbon per year and more than 600 metric tons of nitrogen, the researchers report. Seagrasses can take a hit. When a sudden marine heat wave killed off a portion of the seagrass, it took just three years for the meadow to fully recover its plant density. \u201cIt surprised us how resilient these seagrass meadows were,\u201d says Karen McGlathery, a coastal ecologist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. She believes the team\u2019s work is more than just a great case study in restoration. It \u201coffers a blueprint for restoring and maintaining healthy seagrass ecosystems\u201d that others can adapt elsewhere in the world, she says. Seagrasses are among the world\u2019s most valuable and most threatened ecosystems, and are important globally as reservoirs of what\u2019s known as  blue carbon , the carbon stored in ocean and coastal ecosystems.  Seagrass  meadows are among the most efficient storers of carbon on Earth, preventing carbon from escaping to the atmosphere as heat-trapping carbon dioxide. These underwater prairies also support near-shore and offshore fisheries, and protect coastlines as well as other marine habitats. Despite their importance,  seagrasses have declined  globally by some 30 percent since 1879, according to an Aug. 14 study in  Frontiers in Marine Science . \u201cThe study helps fill some large gaps in our understanding of how blue carbon can contribute to climate restoration,\u201d says McGlathery. \u201cIt\u2019s\u00a0the first to put a number on how much carbon restored meadows take out of the atmosphere and store,\u201d for decades and potentially for centuries. The restoration is far from finished. But already, it may point the way for struggling ecosystems such as Florida\u2019s Biscayne Bay, once rich in seagrass but now suffering from water quality degradation and widespread fish kills. \u00a0 Once the water is cleaned up , says Orth, \u201cour work suggests that  seagrasses can recover  rapidly\u201d ( SN: 3/5/18 ). McGlathery also believes the scale of the team\u2019s success should be uplifting for coastal communities. \u201cIn my first years here, there was no seagrass and there hadn\u2019t been for decades. Today, as far as I can swim, I see lush meadows, rays, the occasional seahorse. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d "},

This iguana was photographed in Key Biscayne, Fla., following a cold snap in January. Brett Pierce", "date": "October 30, 2020 at 11:00 am", "content": "fter the coldest night in south Florida in a decade, lizards were dropping out of palm trees, landing legs up. The scientists who raced to investigate the fallen reptiles have now found that, despite such graceless falls, some of these tropical, cold-blooded creatures are actually more resilient to cold than previously thought. The finding sheds light on how some species might respond to  extreme weather events caused by human-caused climate change  ( SN: 12/10/19 ). Although climate change is expected to include gradual warming globally, scientists think that extreme events such as heat waves, cold snaps, droughts and torrential downpours could also grow in number and strength over time. The idea for the new study was born after evolutionary ecologist James Stroud received a photo of a roughly 60-centimeter-long iguana on its back on a sidewalk from a friend in Key Biscayne, an island town south of Miami. The previous night, temperatures dropped to just under 4.4\u00b0 Celsius (40\u00b0 Fahrenheit). \u201cWhen air temperatures drop below a critical limit, lizards lose the ability to move,\u201d says Stroud, of Washington University in St. Louis. Lizards that sleep in trees \u201cmay lose their grip.\u201d Stunned lizards on the ground are likely easy prey for predators, he notes. Realizing that the cold snap could be used to study how future instances of  extreme weather  might affect such animals in the wild, Stroud and colleagues rushed to collect live specimens of as many different kinds of lizards as they could in the Miami area ( SN: 8/27/20 ). The researchers then tested how well the six reptile species they captured tolerated cold by sticking thermometers on the animals, placing them in a large cooler of ice and observing how cold they got before becoming too stunned to right themselves after getting flipped on their backs. Stroud and colleagues had previously run similar tests on these lizard species as part of research on  invasive species . That work in 2016 suggested that the reptiles might not easily withstand cold snaps like the recent one \u2014  cold tolerances  ranged from as low as about 7.7\u00b0 C for the Puerto Rican crested anole ( Anolis cristatellus ) to roughly 11.1\u00b0 C for the brown basilisk ( Basiliscus vittatus ). The new study, however, revealed that  the reptiles now could withstand temperatures roughly 1 to 4 degrees  C colder. Oddly, the lizards, on average, could all endure cold down to the same lowest temperature, about 5.5\u00b0 C, the researchers report in the October  Biology Letters . Given the great variation in size, ecology and physiology between these species, \u201cthis was a really unexpected result,\u201d and one that the researchers don\u2019t have an explanation for, Stroud says. Natural selection may be behind the change, meaning that abnormally cold temperatures are killing off those individuals that could not survive and leaving behind those that happen to be better able to tolerate cold. Alternatively, the reptiles\u2019 bodies could have changed in some way to acclimate to the colder temperatures. Stroud hopes in the future to measure the cold tolerance of lizards immediately before a forecasted cold snap and then examine the same reptiles immediately afterward to look for signs of acclimation. Scientists have long thought that tropical species, which have typically evolved in thermally stable environments, might prove especially vulnerable to  major shifts in temperature  ( SN: 5/20/15 ). This new study reveals a way in which species can either rapidly evolve or acclimate, which \u201cmay provide ecosystems with some resilience to extreme climate events,\u201d says Alex Pigot, an ecologist at University College London who did not take part in the research. One remaining question \u201cis whether this resilience also applies to extreme heating events,\u201d Pigot adds. \u201cPrevious evidence has suggested that species\u2019 upper thermal limits may be less flexible than their lower thermal limits.\u201d "},

As they\u2019re used and cast away, these plastic products shed tiny particles. The broken-down bits of bags, bottles and other consumer plastics, each smaller than 5 millimeters, can harm animals, such as marine crabs that get  plastics stuck in their gills  ( SN: 7/8/14 ). They may also  mess with ecosystems   (SN: 1/31/20) . Here are some of the most extreme places where microplastics have been found. All of the 11 snow samples that Napper\u2019s team analyzed from Mount Everest contained plastic, the researchers report November 20 in  One Earth.  \u201cI had no idea what the results were going to look like \u2026 so that really took me aback,\u201d says Napper. The highest concentration of microplastics \u2014 119,000 pieces per cubic meter \u2014 was in snow from Everest Base Camp, where climbers congregate, but plastic pieces also appeared at a spot 8,440 meters above sea level, near the 8,850-meter summit. The scientists also found plastics in three of eight samples of stream water from Everest. Perhaps the finding should not have been so surprising: Hundreds of people attempt to summit the mountain each year, leaving piles of trash behind. The majority of the microplastics found were polyester fibers, likely originating from climbers\u2019 equipment and clothes. Plastic pollution in the sea goes far deeper than the floating  Pacific garbage patch  ( SN: 3/22/18 ). Scientists have fished  plastic fibers and fragments from the guts  of critters dwelling in ocean trenches around the Pacific Rim. Of 90 crustaceans analyzed in a 2019 study, 65 contained microplastics, with the deepest coming from 10,890 meters down in the Mariana Trench. In another study, a sampling of water in the Monterey Bay suggests that  plastic debris is accumulating  below the surface and is most prevalent at 200 to 600 meters deep ( SN: 6/6/19 ). Carried through the air,  microplastics can make their way  to remote areas such as a meteorological station in the Pyrenees Mountains ( SN: 4/15/19 ). On average, an estimated 365 microplastic particles per square meter per day rained down on that site during the study period, about as much as falls from the sky in some cities. Simulations of wind directions and speed suggest the plastic fragments traveled at least 95 kilometers before landing at the site. A 2018 study reported  millions to tens of millions  of microplastic pieces per cubic meter from melted Arctic ice cores. The research team identified 17 types of plastic, including some used in packaging materials and others used in paints or fibers. Another 2020 report found  lower concentrations for sea ice cores , ranging from 2,000 to 17,000 plastic particles per cubic meter. The 2020 study also found that water beneath ice floes held between 0 to 18 microplastic particles per cubic meter.\u00a0 A 2019 study estimates that an average American  consumes between 39,000 and 52,000 pieces  of microplastic a year. Researchers came up with this number by drawing on previous studies that had surveyed plastic pieces in tap and bottled water and in certain food items, such as fish, sugar, salt and alcohol. "},

But \u201cthis is not just an ocean issue. It\u2019s a land issue, too. It\u2019s everywhere.\u201d About 390,000 dromedary camels ( Camelus dromedarius ) live in the United Arab Emirates. Now in a study in the February 2021  Journal of Arid Environments , Eriksen, Wernery and colleagues estimate that plastic kills around  1 percent of these culturally important animals . Of 30,000 dead camels that Wernery, a veterinary microbiologist at the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory in Dubai, and his team have examined since 2008, 300 had guts packed with plastic. In a subset of five camels, the plastic weighed from three to 64 kilograms. The researchers dubbed these plastic masses \u201cpolybezoars\u201d to distinguish them from naturally occurring hair and plant fiber bezoars. As dromedaries roam the desert looking for food, they munch on plastic bags and other trash that drift into trees and pile up along roadsides. \u201cFrom the camel\u2019s perspective \u2026 if it\u2019s not sand, it\u2019s food,\u201d Eriksen says. With a stomach full of plastic, camels don\u2019t eat because they don\u2019t feel hungry, and they starve to death. Plastic can also leach toxins and introduce bacteria that poison the one-humped mammals, Wernery says. \u201cIf 1 percent mortality due to plastic is verified by future and more detailed studies, then plastic pollution will certainly represent a reason of concern for [camels],\u201d says Luca Nizzetto, an environmental scientist at the Norwegian Institute for Water Research in Oslo, who was not involved with the research. \u201cThese types of studies are relevant to raise social awareness about this pollution.\u201d Banning plastic bags and single-use plastics is crucial for protecting camels and other wildlife, Eriksen says. \u201cPlastic bags are escape artists.

Green burials do not use concrete vaults, embalm bodies or use pesticides or fertilizers at gravesites. Bodies are buried in a biodegradable container like a pinewood or wicker casket, or a cotton or silk shroud. Proponents of the small but growing trend argue it is more environmentally friendly and in line with how burials were done before the invention of the modern funeral home industry. But when researchers asked 20 residents of Lawrence, Kan., over the age of 60 who identify as environmentalists if they had considered green burial,  most hadn\u2019t heard of the practice . That\u2019s despite the fact that green burial had been available in Lawrence for nearly a decade at the time. More than half of the survey participants planned on cremation, because they viewed it as the eco-friendliest option, the team reported online January 26 in  Mortality. In 2008, Lawrence became the first U.S. city to allow green burials in a publicly owned cemetery. Several years later, at a meeting of an interfaith ecological community organization in the city, sociologist Paul Stock of the University of Kansas in Lawrence and his colleague Mary Kate Dennis noticed that most of the attendees were older adults. These people \u201clive and breathe their environmentalism,\u201d says Dennis, now a social work researcher at the University of Manitoba in Canada. \u201cWe were curious if it followed them all the way through to their burials.\u201d That the majority of participants in the new survey leaned towards cremation aligns with national trends. Cremation recently surpassed traditional burial as the most popular death care choice in the United States. In July 2020, the National Funeral Directors Association projected  the cremation rate that year would be 56 percent  compared to 38 percent for casket burials. By 2040, the cremation rate is projected to grow to about 78 percent while the burial rate is estimated to shrink to about 16 percent. Cremation\u2019s growing popularity can be traced to a number of factors, including affordability and concerns about traditional burial\u2019s environmental impacts. But cremation comes with its own environmental cost, releasing hundreds of kilograms of carbon dioxide into the air per body. The preference for green burial, meanwhile, is small but growing. The Green Burial Council was founded in 2005 to establish green burial standards by certifying green burial sites. Now 14 percent of Americans over age 40 say they would choose green burial, the NFDA reports, and around 62 percent are open to exploring it. For those who go the green burial route, there now are a variety of commercially available choices. More adventurous options include a burial suit designed to sprout mushrooms as the body decomposes, an egg-shaped burial pod that eventually grows into a tree and  human composting  ( SN: 2/16/20 ) \u2014 a one- to two-month process that turns the body into soil. In 2019, Washington became the first and only U.S. state to legalize human composting.\u00a0 Conservation burial cemeteries take the green burial concept a step further by doubling as protected nature preserves. To date, the Green Burial Council has certified over 200 green burial sites and eight conservation burial sites in North America. Such initiatives showcase a growing awareness that death care choices can have a positive impact on ecosystems, says Lynne Carpenter-Boggs, a soil scientist at Washington State University in Pullman and a research advisor for the Seattle-based human composting company Recompose. But, she cautions, there is still little formal research comparing the environmental impacts of different death care choices. Stock and Dennis think this lack of research, coupled with a general lack of awareness of green burial as an available choice, could be the reason why many of the environmentalists they spoke with weren\u2019t yet considering it. But as the option becomes more widely available, Dennis says, \u201cit will be interesting to see how that shifts.\u201d "},

That\u2019s about 17 percent of all food that was available to consumers that year, a new United Nations report estimates. \u201cThrowing away food de facto means throwing away the resources that went into its production,\u201d said Martina Otto, who leads the U.N. Environment Program\u2019s work on cities, during a news conference. \u201cIf food waste ends up in landfills, it does not feed people, but it does feed climate change.\u201d Some 690 million people are impacted by hunger each year, and over 3 billion people can\u2019t afford a healthy diet. Meanwhile, lost and wasted food accounts for 8 to 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Reducing food waste  could ease both of those problems , according to the Food Waste Index Report 2021 published March 4 by the U.N. Environment Program and WRAP, an environmental charity based in the United Kingdom. Researchers analyzed food waste data from 54 countries. Most waste \u2014 61 percent \u2014 came from homes. Food services such as restaurants accounted for 26 percent of global food waste while retail outlets such as supermarkets contributed just 13 percent. Surprisingly, food waste was a substantial problem for nearly all countries regardless of their income level, the team found. \u201cWe thought waste was predominantly a problem in rich countries,\u201d Otto said. While the report is the most comprehensive analysis of global food waste to date, several knowledge gaps remain. The 54 countries account for just 75 percent of the world\u2019s population, and only 23 countries provided waste estimates for their food service or retail sectors. The researchers accounted for these gaps by extrapolating values for the rest of the world from countries that did track these data. The report does not differentiate between potentially edible wasted food and inedible waste such as eggshells or bones. Otto recommends that countries begin addressing food waste by integrating reduction into their climate strategies and COVID-19 recovery plans. \u201cFood waste has been largely overlooked in national climate strategies,\u201d Otto said. \u201cWe know what to do, and we can take action quickly \u2014 collectively and individually.\u201d "},

With moderate heat, enzyme-laced films of the plastic  disintegrated  in standard compost or plain tap water  within days to weeks, Ting Xu and her colleagues report April 21 in  Nature. \u201cBiodegradability does not equal compostability,\u201d says Xu, a polymer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. She often finds bits of biodegradable plastic in the compost she picks up for her parents\u2019 garden. Most biodegradable plastics go to landfills, where the conditions aren\u2019t right for them to break down, so they degrade no faster than normal plastics. Embedding polymer-chomping enzymes in biodegradable plastic should accelerate decomposition. But that process often inadvertently forms potentially harmful microplastics,  which are showing up in ecosystems across the globe  ( SN: 11/20/20 ). The enzymes clump together and randomly snip plastics\u2019 molecular chains, leading to an incomplete breakdown. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than if you don\u2019t degrade them in the first place,\u201d Xu says. Her team added individual enzymes into two biodegradable plastics, including polylactic acid, commonly used in food packaging. They inserted the enzymes along with another ingredient, a degradable additive Xu previously developed, which ensured the enzymes didn\u2019t clump together and didn\u2019t fall apart. The solitary enzymes grabbed the ends of the plastics\u2019 molecular chains and ate as though they were slurping spaghetti, severing every chain link and preventing microplastic formation. Adding enzymes usually makes plastic expensive and compromises its properties. However, Xu\u2019s enzymes make up as little as 0.02 percent of the plastic\u2019s weight, and her plastics are as strong and flexible as one typically used in grocery bags. The technology doesn\u2019t work on all plastics because their molecular structures vary, a limitation Xu\u2019s team is working to overcome. She\u2019s filed a patent application for the technology, and a coauthor founded a startup to commercialize it. \u201cWe want this to be in every grocery store,\u201d she says. "},

That\u2019s awfully strange. Even among other two-legged species, none amble about with a straight back and a gait that, technically, is just a form of controlled falling. Our bipedalism doesn\u2019t just set us apart, paleoanthropologist Jeremy DeSilva posits; it\u2019s what makes us human. There\u2019s no shortage of books that propose this or that feature\u2009\u2014\u2009tool use or self-awareness, for example\u2009\u2014\u2009as the very definition of humankind. But much of our supposed uniqueness doesn\u2019t stand up to this tradition. In  First Steps , DeSilva takes a slightly different approach. Our way of walking, he argues, set off an array of consequences that inform our peculiar evolutionary history. DeSilva starts his tour through the annals of bipedalism with other upright organisms.  Tyrannosaurus  and  ancient crocodile relatives  are trotted out to show how they moved on two legs, thanks to long, counterbalancing tails ( SN: 6/12/20 ). DeSilva stumbles a little here, like arguing that \u201cbipedalism was not a successful locomotion for many dinosaur lineages.\u201d An entire group\u2009\u2014\u2009the theropods\u2009\u2014\u2009walked on two legs and still do in their avian guises. But the comparison with dinosaurs is still worthwhile. With no tail, the way we walk is even stranger. \u201cLet\u2019s face it,\u201d DeSilva writes, \u201chumans are weird.\u201d Each following chapter gets more surefooted as DeSilva guides readers through what we\u2019ve come to know about how our ancestors came to be bipedal. This is breezy popular science at its best, interweaving anecdotes from the field and lab with scientific findings and the occasional pop culture reference. DeSilva gets extra credit for naming oft-overlooked experts who made key discoveries. Instead of presenting a march of progress toward ever-greater bipedal perfection, DeSilva highlights how our ancestors had varied forms of upright walking, such as  the somewhat knock-kneed gait of  Australopithecus sediba  ( SN: 7/25/13 ). The way we now walk, he argues, was one evolutionary pathway among many possibilities. But walking upright opened up unique evolutionary avenues, DeSilva notes. Freed from locomotion, our arms and hands could become defter at creating and manipulating tools. Our ancestors also evolved a bowl-shaped pelvis to comfortably cradle our viscera. But this arrangement made giving birth more complicated, especially as human infants began to have larger heads that needed to pass through a narrowed birth canal created by this anatomical shift. Such trade-offs, including how debilitating twisted ankles and broken bones can be to humans, may have required our ancestors to care for each other, DeSilva concludes. While that may be a step too far into speculation, he nevertheless makes a compelling case overall. \u201cOur bipedal locomotion was a gateway to many of the unique traits that make us human,\u201d he writes, an evolutionary happenstance that formed the context for how we came to be.

Paul John Myburgh", "date": "April 30, 2021 at 6:00 am", "content": "Little Foot, a nearly complete hominid skeleton painstakingly excavated from rock inside a South African cave, shouldered a powerful evolutionary load. This 3.67-million-year-old adult female sports the oldest and most complete set of shoulder blades and collarbones of any ancient hominid. Those fossils also provide the best available model for what the  shoulders of the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees  looked like, say Kristian Carlson, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, and his colleagues. Their results provide new insights into how both Little Foot and a human-chimp last common ancestor climbed in trees. Little Foot belonged to the  Australopithecus  genus, but her  species identity is in dispute  ( SN: 12/12/18 ). The shape and orientation of her shoulder bones fall between corresponding measures for humans and present-day African apes, but most closely align with gorillas, Carlson reported April 27 at the virtual annual meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists. His talk was based on a paper published online April 20 in the  Journal of Human Evolution . Little Foot lived roughly half-way between modern times and the estimated age of a human-chimp common ancestor, says paleobiologist David Green of Campbell University in Buies Creek, N.C., a member of Carlson\u2019s team. If that ancient ancestral creature was about the size of a chimp, as many researchers suspect, shoulders resembling those of gorillas would have supported slow but competent climbing, Green says. Gorillas spend much of the time knuckle-walking on the ground. These apes climb trees with all four limbs, reaching up with powerful shoulders and arms to pull themselves along. \u201cThe maintenance of a gorilla-like shoulder in Little Foot offers clues that climbing remained vital for early [hominids],\u201d Green says. It\u2019s possible, he added, that Little Foot\u2019s shoulder design represented \u201cevolutionary baggage\u201d among hominids evolving bodies more suited to upright walking. The new analysis makes Little Foot\u2019s shoulders \u201cour best candidate for hypothesizing the appearance of the human-chimp last common ancestor,\u201d says anatomist Susan Larson of Stony Brook University School of Medicine in New York, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. Ancestral shoulders that supported capable tree climbing would have provided a foundation for the evolution of human shoulders aligned with a two-legged stride and chimp shoulders designed for hanging and swinging from tree branches, she suggested. In the new study, a digital, 3-D reconstruction of Little Foot\u2019s more complete right shoulder blade was compared with right shoulder blades of chimps, gorillas, orangutans and present-day people. Further comparisons were made with partial shoulder blades of 11 ancient hominids. Those hominids included four South African  Australopithecus  specimens and East African finds from two members of  Lucy\u2019s species ,  A. afarensis , that date to around 3.3 million and 3.6 million years ago ( SN: 10/25/12 ). Little Foot\u2019s collarbones were compared with those of humans, chimps, gorillas, orangutans and seven ancient hominids. Carlson\u2019s analysis provides preliminary but still uncertain evidence that Little Foot had the most gorilla-like shoulders of any ancient hominid, says paleoanthropologist Stephanie Melillo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. Melillo, who did not participate in the new study, considers it most striking that Little Foot shares many shoulder similarities with the other  Australopithecus  fossils studied by Carlson\u2019s team. Some researchers consider a 4.4-million-year-old  Ardipithecus ramidus  skeleton, dubbed Ardi , the best hominid model for a human-chimp last common ancestor ( SN: 12/31/09 ). Ardi could have moved slowly in trees while holding onto branches above her head, in a manner unlike any modern ape, they contend. But Ardi\u2019s remains lack shoulder blades and collarbones. "}
