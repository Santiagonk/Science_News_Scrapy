While it might seem logical that the existence of a speed of light means there must be a way to determine the speed of darkness, this isn't necessarily true. While it may be possible to define the speed of darkness, this determination is heavily dependent on just how you define the dark.Strictly speaking, dark is simply the absence of light, and thus has no speed at all, according to noted astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. In his opinion, the idea of a speed of darkness is no more than a poetic metaphor, but has no place in legitimate scientific discussion [source: StarTalk].AdvertisementIf you expand the concept of dark, however, it may appear that the dark has a speed all its own. Consider a dark spot in a beam of light, which might be created by placing a piece of cloth or other object over part of the light source. While this dark spot might not meet strict criteria for total darkness, it travels at the same speed as the rest of the non-obstructed light [source: University of Illinois]. This same speed of darkness holds true if you equate darkness to how long it takes for the light to go away when the power is switched off -- again, the speed of dark in this case is equal to the speed of light.Widen the interpretation of darkness a bit further, and consider the speed of dark matter. This mysterious energy makes up 80 percent of all matter in the universe. In a 2013 study, scientists determined that dark matter should have a speed of 54 meters per second, or 177 feet -- slow compared to the speed of light [source: Armendariz-Picon and Neelakanta]. Of course, dark matter velocity is theoretical at this point, as this matter has largely stopped moving, preferring to form haloes around galaxies throughout the universe. The 54 meters per second figure estimated its speed when the universe was first forming, extrapolated to how fast the dark matter could travel today if it were still in motion [source: Woo].Finally, consider what would happen if you extend the definition of darkness to include black holes, which are devoid of light. In 2013, researchers determined that one massive black hole measuring more than 2 million miles (3.2 million kilometers) across was spinning at around 84 percent of the speed of light [source: Fazekas].Originally Published: Jul 28, 2015"},

It's an inflammation of the pharynx, which is the tube that extends from the back of the mouth to the esophagus. The leading causes of your discomfort are:While those are the primary reasons for a sore throat, there are others, including:\u00adA sore throat can be a minor but annoying ailment, or it can be a symptom of a serious illness. Causes range from a stuffy nose or a cold to strep throat, a bacterial throat infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. Since untreated strep throat can lead to rheumatic fever and scarlet fever, it's important to get medical help as early as possible into the illness. Along with producing severe soreness in your gullet, strep throat may be accompanied by fever, body aches and pains and malaise.If you have these symptoms, or if you have a sore throat lasting more than two or three days, it makes good sense to see a doctor.

But what's the difference between them?   "], "date": "Aug 19, 2019", "content": "The average headache or backache often sends people reaching willy-nilly for the nearest bottle of pain reliever, but for best results it's smart to match the particular problem with the perfect pill. That's because the wide variety of pain relievers (known in medical circles as analgesics) available today are each effective at different problems and come with different risks.There are two categories of pain pills suitable for home use \u2014 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, more commonly referred to as NSAIDs, and acetaminophen. Both also are considered antipyretics, which means that they can reduce fevers.Most people know acetaminophen better by the popular brand name Tylenol, but there are other brands as well (like FeverAll). The category of NSAIDs is broader, as aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen all fall under the umbrella (there are others, but these three are some of the most widely used). Each has its own range of brand names associated with it.So, which one is best to use? It all depends on what you're taking it for. We'll clue you in on all these pain relievers below:AdvertisementBrand name: TylenolWhat it is: Acetaminophen was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1951, but how it works is still not clearly understood. Nevertheless, certain facts have been worked out over the years. \"Acetaminophen does not decrease inflammation, but works in the hypothalamus to reduce fever,\" explains pharmacist Tara Thompson, Pharm.D., V.P. of clinical services at Innovation Compounding in an email interview. Additionally, \"it may work peripherally to block the generation of pain.\"When to take it: \"Those with fever, flu-like pain symptoms, or pain from headaches may benefit from taking acetaminophen,\" Thompson says. It also can help with the pain from inflammatory diseases like arthritis and menstrual cramps but note: It'll only mask the pain without treating the underlying inflammation problem.When NOT to take it: Acetaminophen should never be taken while consuming alcohol. It can be hard on the liver even when stone-cold sober, and much worse when consuming alcohol.Most serious liver problems have been reported following large doses (the highest amount that's considered safe is 3,250 milligrams per day or 10 regular-strength tablets.) However, there have been instances when liver damage occurs after medicating with moderate or even small doses over a long time.Acetaminophen should be taken carefully in conjunction with other medications, as many headache and cold meds (like Nyquil) already have the analgesic in them. This can lead to accidental overdoses. Anyone taking one of these \"extras\" should carefully read labels and follow dosing instructions to the letter.Acetaminophen is considered safe enough to take by just about everyone, but occasionally side effects are experienced. Most often, those are nausea, rash and headache, which is ironic since many people take it to treat the latter!AdvertisementBrand names: Bayer, Advil, Motrin, AleveWhat they are: You know how acetaminophen doesn't do a darn thing to reduce inflammation? Well, NSAIDs pick up that dropped ball and run all the way into the endzone with it. Short for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the category of NSAIDs include a variety of analgesics, like aspirin (one brand name is Bayer), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve). Although there's some variation by particular type, NSAIDs in general treat inflammation by blocking the production of chemicals called prostaglandins, which encourage fever, pain and inflammation. Incidentally, steroidal meds also reduce inflammation, which is why this category goes out of its way to denote \"nonsteroidal\" in the name because it's a major distinction.When to take them: \"NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen have specific mechanisms of action in the body which decrease inflammation, so those with inflammatory conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, menstrual pain, or muscular pain would benefit from an NSAID,\" Thompson notes. \"Naproxen tends to work longer in the body (about two times longer!), so those with gout or more chronic pain conditions may see more pain relief from using naproxen versus ibuprofen.\" However, ibuprofen provides quicker relief than naproxen and is less likely to cause an upset stomach, so might be more appropriate for acute pain.Aspirin has long been used as a daily supplement of sorts for people at risk of heart attack and stroke because it inhibits potentially tragic blood clotting for roughly four to seven days. One important caveat, however, is that people consuming aspirin for that purpose should use a lower dosage aspiring (under 325 milligrams per day) than those using it for pain relief purposes. Thompson says that aspirin is more commonly used nowadays for inhibiting blood clotting than for relieving pain, due to intestinal bleeding risks, which brings us to...When NOT to take them: Women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant are typically advised to avoid use of NSAIDs because they are believed to cause fertility issues, early miscarriage and even birth defects. In particular, they should not be taken in the third trimester because they could cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus (a blood vessel in the developing baby).People with gastrointestinal problems might also steer clear of NSAID use. \"NSAIDS are known for their potential negative GI side effects, which can include ulcers or intestinal bleeding,\" Thompson says. This occurs because prostaglandins, those fever- and inflammation-encouraging chemicals that are wrecked by NSAIDs, aren't all bad. In fact, prostaglandins protect the stomach lining and help with blood clotting. When those functions are inhibited, the risk of bleeding and ulcers goes way up.\"Although this is more likely in those who take large doses for long periods of time, patients often turn to acetaminophen [from NSAIDs] for pain relief, since it does not cause intestinal issues,\" says Thompson.Still confused about which to take? \"Your local pharmacist at any retail pharmacy can help recommend the best medication and dose to take for your particular condition, and can help you find the right product on the shelf,\" she adds.Have a hangover? Skip the acetaminophen in favor of an NSAID. Although nothing short of time, rest and lots of hydration can completely cure a hangover, the anti-inflammatory properties that NSAIDs boast are believed to be helpful at combating the effects of alcohol-related ethanol. However, taking an NSAID on an upset stomach (so common with hangovers) can make nausea, gastritis and related discomfort worse."},

You might not be able to see it or feel it working, but it's there, it never sleeps and it's basically got you hogtied. You can't see your genetic material, but it's an entire universe of biological instructions \u2014 and a lot of the time they're not even very good instructions. Your DNA could be making coarse black hairs grow out of your palms right now; it could also be nonchalantly protecting you from cancer. It could also be doing absolutely nothing. There's no telling.Here's the thing: Evolution doesn't have some great plan for you, personally. Whether or not you have genes that tell your palms to grow whiskers and your body to fight cancer \u2014 that's mostly just happenstance. Mostly. But from time to time, DNA has been known to pull incredible Hail Marys.AdvertisementTake elephants, for instance. They very rarely get cancer \u2014 an elephant's cancer mortality rate is just under 5 percent, while we die of cancer between 11 and 25 percent of the time. Whales have very low rates of cancer too \u2014 in fact, large animals of all kinds seem to succumb to cancer way less than one might imagine. This puzzled cancer researchers in the 1950s and '60s because the early understanding of why cancer happens has to do with how many cells an animal has, coupled with its longevity. Large and long-lived animals, scientists theorized, have lots of cells and/or more time in which cells could potentially start doing their jobs wrong. Conversely, small animals have fewer cells and generally don't live as long as larger animals, thus there are fewer chances and less time for cells to mutate in ways that would result in cancer. This line of reasoning makes a good bit of sense, right? Yet in the 1970s, statistical epidemiologist Richard Peto observed that we don't see a higher incidence of cancer in humans than we do in mice, even though human bodies contain 1,000 times more cells and live 30 times as long.It was in this way that science was introduced to Peto's Paradox, the mystery that's bedeviled cancer researchers for nearly half a century. Even though cancer reliably shows up in larger individuals within a species more often than in little ones \u2014 for instance, a couple inches of height on a human can significantly raise her chances of getting some types of cancer \u2014 for whatever reason, huge and long-lived animals have cancer rates comparable to or lower than our own.Because being humongous has evolved countless times over the eons, there are probably as many solutions to Peto's Paradox as there are gigantic-bodied animals. However, a new study published in the Aug. 14, 2018, issue of Cell Reports finds that the reason for Peto's Paradox in elephants is, in reality, completely bonkers.Previous research reported that African savannah elephants (Loxodonta africana) have a whole bunch of copies of a specific cancer-fighting gene called TP53. This gene produces a protein that combs cells looking for potential DNA damage. Humans (and most other animals) have only one copy of this gene \u2014 elephants, it happens, have 20 copies. So, T53 lends the elephant a lot of capacity to see that there is a problem, but not the ability to do anything about it.The University of Chicago research team rummaged around in the elephant genome to see if they could find any clue as to who would be carrying out the cell repairs or cell destruction that gives elephants their cancer-fighting powers, and they found something pretty obvious: Elephants have between seven and 11 copies of a type of gene known as \"leukemia inhibitory factor,\" or LIF. The problem was, these copies were old \u2014 many of them had probably been useful to the elephant's evolutionary progenitors, but they were so degraded they were probably completely useless.And this is where things start getting weird.\"What we actually found was a copy of LIF \u2014 LIF6 \u2014 which had integrated into the genome in the common ancestor of elephants and manatees,\" says lead author Juan Manuel Vazquez, graduate student in the Department of Human Genetics at the University of Chicago. \"Manatees still have this piece of DNA, but it's what we'd traditionally consider 'junk.' But elephants took this junk DNA and, right before it lost any and all coding potential for the correct protein, it evolved a new way of inducing its activation and expression into a functional protein again. It was pure luck.\"So, as a last-ditch attempt to cut down on the accumulation of bad cells, the elephant resurrected a piece of DNA that's capable of killing cells that have been flagged for execution by TP53 and put it to work culling cells with DNA damage.\"We coined the term 'zombie gene' because we couldn't find any other case where this has happened \u2014 right before a piece of junk DNA becomes purely junk or evolves into something useful,\" says Vazquez.And, you know, it could have gone wrong. What's amazing is the elephant was able to both reactivate the gene and control it \u2014 to tell LIF6 to kill, not every cell, but just the ones that seemed the most dangerous.You can't control your DNA, but sometimes it can come out with some pretty cute tricks you'd never even think of.LIF6 kills cells by poking holes in the mitochondria, the power plant of the cell."},

Instead, it's a real place, resting in the immensity of the Pacific Ocean. If you've ever spent time in Australia or New Zealand, you were in Oceania, but that's just the beginning. This unimaginably vast region stretches on for many more miles, often just bits of dry land peeking out of the great blue ocean. Here are nine things to know about it.AdvertisementOceania is an incredibly vast geographical region with boundaries that geographers can't quite agree on. It consists of Australia, and a constellation of islands, large and small, mostly located north and east of Australia. By some counts, there are roughly 10,000 such islands covering more than 100 million square kilometers (38,600,000 square miles) of ocean surface, but just over 8 million square kilometers (3 million square miles) of land.The region's so enormous that if you include surface water and surface land, it's bigger than all the other land area on Earth \u2013 combined.Most of the islands are downright tiny and uninhabited. But others, like New Zealand and the eastern half of New Guinea, are sizable by comparison.AdvertisementOceania is so enormous that geographers break it into smaller chunks. The most common subdivisions are Australia, followed by Melanesia (from New Guinea island in the southwestern Pacific Ocean to Tonga); Micronesia (more than 600 islands in the Pacific, like Palau, Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia); and Polynesia (more than 1,000 islands including New Zealand, Cook Island, Samoa and Hawaii.)People have lived in Australia for at least 60,000 years, and they reached the Solomon Islands about 30,000 years ago. But in other tiny remote areas of Southeast Asia, humans are relative newcomers, having arrived just 1,000 years ago.How they did so befuddles many scientists, who struggle to see how prehistoric people with few instruments could possibly navigate the vast waters separating these far-flung outposts.AdvertisementOceania is known for its cannibalistic past. In 1839, two British missionaries visited Erromango, part of the Vanuatu archipelago, which in older times was called Martyr's Island. They were devoured by the locals. Anthropologists believe that cannibalism was practiced in that area until at least 1969. One local in 2008 even gave out the recipe for cooking a human after killing (baking time is three to five hours.)On Fiji, the practice of human flesh eating survived until at least the 1800s. The belief was that eating your enemies transferred their power to you. Even in 2011, there were reports that a German tourist was eaten in French Polynesia, though experts think it was more likely a garden-variety murder with the killer trying to burn evidence of the body. Nowadays, \"cannibal tours\" are offered for tourists, and souvenir shops selling \"cannibal dolls\" are abundant in the Pacific Islands.AdvertisementSome sources estimate that sheep actually outnumber people in Oceania. Most of its landmasses are sparsely populated, but there are roughly 42 million people living there, strewn throughout 14 different countries.Australia (25 million) makes up most of the population, followed by Papua New Guinea (9 million), New Zealand (5 million), Fiji (1 million) and the Solomon Islands (nearly 700,000). The remaining countries are Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.Territories and dependencies include American Samoa, Cook Islands, French Polynesia, Guam, New Caledonia, Niue, Northern Mariana Islands, Pitcairn Island, Tokelau, and Wallis and Futuna. Niue and Tokelau are the least populated places in Oceania \u2014 less than 1,700 people each.AdvertisementNo wonder the region is called Oceania \u2014 water is Oceania's defining feature.\u00a0Most of the region is under the Pacific Ocean \u2014 just 8 percent is aboveground (as we said earlier 100 million square kilometers of ocean but just 8 million square kilometers of land). Given its small percentage of landmass, perhaps it's no surprise that Oceania's population density is just eight people per square kilometer (roughly three people per square mile).AdvertisementSafety alert: please do not try this at home.On the southern tip of Pentecost Island, Vanuatu, the local men practice what's called Gol, or Nanggol \u2013 land diving. They construct haphazard-looking stick towers, tie vines to their ankles and then jump off headfirst.These plunges see the hurtling bodies reaching speeds of 45 mph (72 kph) or more. And the most successful dives are the ones where the men can tuck their heads at the last moment and lightly brush their shoulders against the ground, stopping just short of certain death.Good dives \u2013 ostensibly, the ones where people survive \u2013 supposedly ensure a bountiful yam harvest. The event is now a tourist attraction and is considered the progenitor to modern bungee jumping, only without any safety features whatsoever ... unless you count forest vines. The country has tried to get royalties from adventure companies that apparently ripped off the practice.AdvertisementAs the planet warms due to climate change, rising seas are encroaching on Oceania's islands. One Polynesian island, named Tuvalu, about halfway between Australia and Hawaii \u2013 is, as the locals say, \"sinking.\"As the waters rise, the beaches are slipping under the waves, slowly devouring this small island. Crops fail to thrive in the salty soil. Climate change-related illnesses (like ciguatera poisoning from consuming fish that eat micro-algaes expelled from bleached coral) are increasing. Tuvalu is home to 11,000 people and is the fourth-smallest country on Earth. But it may not be home to anyone in the next 50 to 100 years, or perhaps even sooner. The island of Kiribati is also \"disappearing.\"AdvertisementOceania is home to dozens of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. These sites meet stringent criteria for their importance in relation to cultural, natural or historical landmarks.In that regard, Oceania contains an embarrassment of riches. Here, you'll find UNESCO World Heritage sites like Australia's famed (and dying) Great Barrier Reef, Hawaii's Mauna Loa (the largest active volcano on the planet), the Auckland Islands, the Sydney Opera House and Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands.And how about Mount Cook National Park, which protects New Zealand's tallest mountain? There's also Fraser Island, the world's largest sand island, and the Phoenix Islands Protected Area, which preserves one of the biggest remaining oceanic wildernesses on Earth.AdvertisementDue to its sheer sprawling size, Oceania includes millions of people living in starkly different circumstances. Australia and New Zealand both land in the top 10 of the United Nations Human Development Index, which shows where countries rank according to standard of living, life expectancy and other factors.Near the bottom of the list lie Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. These are some of what the U.N. calls the Least Developed Countries. For example, the gross domestic product per capita in Australia is more than $51,000 while in the Solomon Islands it is around $2,400. New Zealanders can expect to live past 82 years on average; on Vanuatu, the average is 70 years.Sydney, Australia is Oceania's biggest and most diverse city. About 5 million people live there. And as the great mixing pot of this region, more than 250 languages are spoken in the city."},

Miller, an emeritus professor of history and philosophy of science at University College London and author of the 2009 book \"137: Jung, Pauli and the Pursuit of a Scientific Obsession,\" says via email.AdvertisementTo physicists, 137 is the approximate denominator of the fine-structure constant (1/137.03599913), the measure of the strength of the electromagnetic force that controls how charged elementary particles such as the electron and muon interact with photons of light, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The fine-structure constant is one of the key physical constants of the universe. \"This immutable number determines how stars burn, how chemistry happens and even whether atoms exist at all,\" as Michael Brooks explained in a recent New Scientist article.The fine-structure constant \"characterizes the strength with which matter couples to light, e.g. the probability that an excited atom will decay in a certain time,\" Paul Davies, Regents Professor of Physics at Arizona State University and a best-selling author of 30 books on science, explains in an email. If the constant was bigger, \"atoms would decay faster. It is significant too because it is a pure number \u2013 a ratio of quantities with equal units. Unlike, say, the speed of light, which is either 186,000 miles per second or 300,000 kilometers per second, depending on which units you prefer.\" (Davies wrote this 2016 article on the fine-structure constant for Cosmos.)In this video, British physicist Laurence Eaves explains that if the fine structure constant was a different value, \"physics, chemistry, biochemistry would be totally different \u2013 and we might not be around to talk about it.\"But practically from the time of its discovery in 1915 by German physicist Arnold Sommerfeld, who originally rendered it as 0.00729, the fine-structure constant seemed to signify some larger metaphysical truth as well. The fine-structure constant \"determines the distance between an atom's spectral lines, which are the atom's DNA,\" Miller explains. \"And so it is one of those numbers that is at the root of the universe. If it were any other value then the structure of matter would be very different, and so us too. People began referring to it as a mystical number.\"Miller continues: \"The language of the spectra \u2013 the spectral lines where Sommerfeld found it \u2013 is a true music of the spheres within the atom,\" he wrote. \"People asked why it has this particular value. Physicists could only conclude that it cannot have this value by accident. It is 'out there,' independent of the structure of our minds.\"But in 1929, English astrophysicist Arthur Eddington \u2013 who played a key role in establishing the validity of Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity and was an early advocate of the Big Bang theory, among other things \u2013 began expressing it as 1/137. He also saw it as having larger, spiritual implications. \"Arthur Eddington sought a new mysticism which would emerge from the natural sciences,\" Miller says. \"Perhaps, he thought, the clue lay in numbers, particularly the number 137. Eddington's reputation as one of the great astrophysicists of his day put a great deal of weight on this approach.\"AdvertisementAs Miler's book details, Austrian-born quantum physics pioneer Wolfgang Pauli became fascinated with the number as well, since it figured in the mysterious intersection of relativity and quantum theory that he explored with the help of his friend, psychoanalyst Carl Jung. The scientific fixation on the fine-structure constant was such that in 1936, Nature published an article titled \"The Mysterious Number 137.\"But as Pauli learned in the 1950s from a religious scholar, 137 had another significance. It was the number associated with the Kabbalah, an esoteric form of Jewish mysticism \u2013 what Miller calls \"an extraordinary link between mysticism and physics.\"As this article by Billy Phillips from Kabbalahstudent.com details, the number 137 also appears frequently in the Torah. It's the lifespan in years of figures such as Ishmael and Levi, for example, as well the age of Abraham when he bound his son Isaac to an altar in preparation to sacrifice him. And as Phillips explains, if the number of letters in the Torah \u2014 304,805 \u2014 is split into the numerical pairs and reversed, the result is the numbers 50, 84 and 03. Add those together, and you get 137. Beyond that, the relationship of the fine-structure constant to light in physics parallels the Kabbalists' concept of connecting with light, or becoming enlightened by shedding the ego.\"The missing puzzle piece for physics is consciousness,\" Phillips writes.As this 2016 Smithsonian article describes, physicist Richard Feynman predicted that the periodic table would end at 137, based on the rules of relativity."},

The auroras, both surrounding the north magnetic pole (aurora borealis) and south magnetic pole (aurora australis) occur when highly charged electrons from the solar wind interact with elements in the earth's atmosphere. Solar winds stream away from the sun at speeds of about 1 million miles per hour. When they reach the earth, some 40 hours after leaving the sun, they follow the lines of magnetic force generated by the earth's core and flow through the magnetosphere, a teardrop-shaped area of highly charged electrical and magnetic fields.\u00adAs the electrons enter the earth's upper atmosphere, they will encounter atoms of oxygen and nitrogen at altitudes from 20 to 200 miles above the earth's surface. The color of the aurora depends on which atom is struck, and the altitude of the meeting.AdvertisementAll of the magnetic and electrical forces react with one another in constantly shifting combinations. These shifts and flows can be seen as the auroras \"dance,\" moving along with the atmospheric currents that can reach 20,000,000 amperes at 50,000 volts. (In contrast, the circuit breakers in your home will disengage when current flow exceeds 15-30 amperes at 120 volts.)The auroras generally occur along the \"auroral ovals,\" which center on the magnetic poles (not the geographic poles) and roughly correspond with the Arctic and Antarctic circles. There are times, though, when the lights are farther south, usually when there are a lot of sunspots. Sunspot activity follows an 11-year cycle. The next peak will occur in 2011 and 2012, so opportunities to see auroras outside their normal range should be good.For more information on auroras, check out the links on the next page."},

But that doesn't quite answer the question of whether or not it's the safest place to be to ride out a storm. There are a ton of \"try this in a tornado\" myths out there, and you don't want to be caught testing out a worthless old wives' tale in 200 mph (322 kph) winds when a cow is flying at your head.Just to err on the safe on side, let's start with a few places you should not hide in a tornado: freeway underpasses, mobile homes and your car. Underpasses create wind tunnel effects and leave you vulnerable to airborne debris, while mobile homes and your car are all one gust away from liftoff in tornado conditions.AdvertisementThe one place you should definitely go? A safe, secure shelter in a modern, reinforced concrete building. (Although you should take advantage of designated shelters in places like churches and schools, as well.)Well, that's all fine and good, you might think, if you have the time to get to your nearest shelter. But if you're currently standing in the middle of your home and watching a tornado approach, you're probably looking for something quicker. And we guess you're not appreciating this wordy introduction before answering the question at hand. So, let's get to the point.A bathtub can be a safe place to find shelter at home. However, this comes with a few conditions. If your bathroom is one of the most interior places of your house, go for it. But if your bathroom or bathtub is on (or even in a room with) an exterior facing wall \u2014 or if there are outside-facing windows \u2014 best to leave it for a more secure space. The idea is that you want to have as many walls between you and the tornado as possible, so interior rooms are best [source: Austin]. (Think closets or laundry rooms, usually snugly fit in the house.) Do try to cover yourself with cushions or heavy blankets to shield yourself from debris.So, while it's not a  foolproof plan \u2014 remember that bathtubs aren't inherently heavy enough to stand firm no matter what \u2014 sheltering yourself in the tub is a good idea if your bathroom is windowless and located in your home's interior.Originally Published: Aug 19, 2015"},

Staying fit is more important now than ever. Study after study has shown that exercise produces endorphins, chemicals that basically act like painkillers in our bodies. Regular aerobic exercise also decreases tension, can elevate and stabilize mood, and improve sleep \u2014 probably things we can all benefit from right now.So when gyms and yoga studios were forced to close due to the coronavirus pandemic, many savvy trainers put their classes online not just to ensure their businesses had a chance of survival \u2014 but also to help their clients' stay fit.But working out at home isn't a new phenomenon. There are plenty of tried-and-true exercise programs you can do from home, even if they have to be slightly tweaked. Melissa Feldman, M.S., a Sarasota, Florida-based yoga teacher, exercise physiologist and health coach says the first place to start is considering what you have access to. If you normally run but can't get outside, or you like to lift weights but don't have any of your own, don't let that stop you.\"Maybe it's a good opportunity to do something else that you might like,\" Feldman says. \"It might be a really great time to try something new. Usually when you try something new, your body responds very positively.\" That's because you'd be using different muscle groups \u2014 or perhaps venturing into a mind-body activity \u2014 and those new exercises can have multiple benefits. Here are seven exercise programs you can easily do at home that will keep you moving.AdvertisementJane Fonda and Richard Simmons might have led the charge here, but today's offerings in workout videos are diverse enough to appeal to bodybuilders and ballerinas alike. From 20-minute, no equipment, no excuses workouts like those from TMAC Fitness to the 3,400-plus classes available on Pilates Anytime, do a bit of online searching to find the program that appeals to you. Most of them charge a monthly all-access fee and offer a complimentary trial period, but if you really need to get a free workout, YouTube will have you covered. Best of all, these workouts are available just when you want them.AdvertisementHitting the living room and clicking play on a recorded workout sounds great for those folks that are fine working out on their own, but what about someone who needs the motivation of a group class and feedback from others to get into the groove? Feldman says the trick to staying inspired is scheduling your workouts \u2014 or even choosing live participation \u2014 rather than going back later and watching the recorded feed of the Facebook Live class.\"Put them in your calendar,\" she says. \"If you are motivated to go to a class, you'll be motivated to do the livestream. It also supports the studios.\" Find live classes through the gyms and studios where you already have memberships because they may have moved their classes and sessions to a virtual, live format.What's exciting about the virtual nature of these live workouts is that you can also try classes and instructors in other parts of the country or the world. ClassPass, an app that pairs people with fitness classes, enables its studio partners to provide livestream classes on its platform, and the Mindbody app now has a virtual search capability to identify studios offering online classes.AdvertisementYou'll get more from your fitness routine when you work out with a personal trainer, according to Shape magazine. A trainer will teach you new exercises, help you push past a plateau and give you feedback. Don't let social distancing stop you from receiving these benefits. If you have a trainer you love, set up virtual training sessions.One-on-one training may be expensive, so to keep a handle on cost, consider semi-private lessons via a platform like Zoom. Teaming up with a workout partner and a trainer will also make you more accountable. In fact, there are a variety of ways to keep a personal trainer in your virtual lifestyle. Caliber pairs clients with a trainer who creates a fitness program and checks in regularly rather than being present through each workout.AdvertisementThere are treadmills, rowing machines, ellipticals, and there once was the ThighMaster. All of these pieces of equipment can be part of a home gym and an at-home fitness routine. With smart technology, equipment has evolved so that you no longer have to feel stuck at home or alone.The Peloton Bike or Tread brings motivation to you with an on-demand library and live classes with a real instructor. Peloton has special classes with DJs joining the instructors for a \"club-like feel.\" And while you are training, you can commune with other members, even sending them high fives.In homes pressed for space, a slimmer solution like Mirror offers an interactive display with live classes, on-demand workouts and the ability to offer feedback \u2014 it has an embedded camera and can be connected with a Bluetooth heart-rate monitor. Tonal is a space-saving home fitness system with a virtual personal trainer and can deliver 200 pounds of resistance. All of these come at a cost, though.AdvertisementIf one of the smart-live-streaming-futuristic home gyms is better defined as budget busting, the smart device in your pocket may have the solution to getting a great workout at home. Fitness apps can help you plan, track and improve your fitness routine. Sworkit allows users to customize programs to fitness level and goals and offers extras like a fitness community and the ability to ask a trainer or get personalized coaching.Heavier lifters, there are apps for you too. Digital Trends put together a list of the best ones for anyone who finds the normal routines \"a little too casual.\" But these are just a few examples. When it comes to fitness apps, they come in just about every style and type, including one for the time-crunched \u2014 the J&J Official 7 Minute Workout.AdvertisementThey may or may not be certified to provide fitness instruction, but some celebrities are helping fans stay in shape with everything from advice to live workouts. Vogue asked \"fashionable yogis\" for guidance on developing an at-home practice. Emmy Rossum has invited her Instagram followers to meet her on IG LIVE for Pilates workouts with instructors from Erika Bloom Pilates, Natural Pilates and more. Or you could just work out with Dwayne Johnson, if you dare.AdvertisementIf despite the many connected indoor activities available to make an at-home exercise routine, you crave the great outdoors, you'll have to get creative. You can be like balcony marathon runner Elisha Nochomovitz (who ran the length of a marathon on his balcony!) and just jog in place or back and forth depending on how much space you have, though that's pretty extreme.Maybe an outdoor group fitness class is a possibility, but when it isn't, some people are getting around it by maintaining social distance. A personal trainer in Spain led a workout from the rooftop for students on their balconies; in Utah, a backyard Zumba class allowed people to stay safely separated; or for a quick do-anywhere routine, take a tip from this outdoor, vacation HIIT workout.Why not kill two birds with one stone? You can combine your workout and learning a language at the same time by trying a yoga class in French or do Pilates with a German instructor."},

Libby argues that no one before or since Chopin has contributed as many significant piano works and writes that Chopin's impact on other musicians is \"entirely out of proportion to the number of concerts he gave \u2014 only 30 public performances in 30 years of concertizing.\" In his surprisingly short career, Chopin managed to leave a lasting mark on the classical genre and the music world at large.Born on March 1, 1810, in Zelazowa Wola, Poland, Fryderyk Franciszek Szopen, who went on to be known as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, developed an early ear for music. His parents, Justyna Krzyzanowska and Nicholas Szopen, moved to Warsaw soon after their son's birth when Nicholas found a job as a tutor for aristocratic families. By age 6, Chopin was already playing the piano and toying with composition, so his parents jumped at the opportunity to hone his early talent. They hired professional musician Wojciech Zywny to provide their young son piano lessons, but Chopin quickly outgrew the kid-level classes.\"The education Chopin received in Poland included composition lessons, literature, mathematics, science, instruction in six languages, logic, philosophy, geography and more,\" Roza Kostrzewska Yoder, artistic director of Los Angeles piano studio, Chopin Academy, writes via email. \"It served as a basis for his entire life.\"AdvertisementBy the time he was 8 years old, Chopin was fully writing his own compositions and performing for audiences in salons. By age 16, he had several original piano compositions of varying styles under belt, and his parents enrolled him in the Warsaw Conservatory of Music. After three years there, studying under Polish composer Josef Elsner, Chopin moved on again, thanks to his parents' recognition of his unique mastery and talent. In 1929, he made his debut in Vienna, and over the next few years, played for audiences throughout Poland, Austria and Germany. In 1832, he found a new home in Paris, France.\"The Chopin we know wouldn't have been if not for the superb upbringing of family, the high level of education he received from his insightful teachers, the influence of his friends and the general political and intellectual atmosphere in Poland before he left his home for Paris at the age of 19,\" Yoder says. \"Franz Liszt said, 'the atmosphere in which Chopin saw the light of day and was brought up, like a secure and cozy nest, was filled with a sense of harmony, tranquility, and hard work; those examples of simplicity, piety and delicacy were always the most sweet and dear to him.'\"In addition to Liszt, Chopin became close with other young composers, including Vincenzo Bellini and Felix Mendelssohn, but he soon discovered Parisian audiences weren't always prepared for his more delicate piano stylings since artists like Franz Schubert and Ludwig van Beethoven had reigned supreme prior to his debut. But soon, Chopin crossed paths with a wealthy banking family known as the Rothschilds, and new opportunities emerged as they introduced him to Paris' high society as a well-mannered and sensitive recitalist and teacher. It was during this point in his career that Chopin penned some of his most famous piano works including the \"Ballade in G Minor,\" the \"Fantaisie-Impromptu,\" \"Nocturne of Op. 9\" and \"Nocturne of Op. 15,\" the \"Scherzo in B-flat Minor, Op. 31\" and the \"Sonata in B-flat Minor, Op. 35.\"\"Chopin's music was based on a classical tradition of composition and he always pledged his allegiance to Bach, Mozart, Beethoven and others,\" Yoder says. \"Often (as with his scherzos and sonatas), he adopted classical forms and poured into them a new spirit. His understanding of the fluidity of tempo in rubato, his sensitivity to the beauty of the sound in cantabile, his revolutionary approach to a technique based on naturalness and flexibility, and his aesthetics based on the honesty of sharing deep feelings characterizes his unique style and makes him a pioneer of new pianistic idiom.\"A quick and general breakdown of Chopin's varying genres: He composed ballades (single-movement piano pieces), sonatas (solo pieces usually written in three or four movements), mazurkas (Polish folk pieces), waltzes (dance music in triple meter, often written in 3/4 time), nocturnes (composition inspired by the night), \u00e9tudes (short compositions to demonstrate the skill of a player), scherzos (light, playful compositions), and many, many more styles.\"My favorite pieces by Chopin (and most likely his as well) are the mazurkas,\" Yoder says. \"He wrote two concertos, four ballades, twenty-four etudes, but fifty-seven mazurkas. They were written by him throughout his life as a sort of diary. The mazurkas composed in Poland show direct influence of Polish folk music while the latest ones are more a recollection of it, but all of them result from his intimate connection with his source of his emotions \u2014 his family and friends as well as the country of his origin.\"AdvertisementAs his musical career thrived, Chopin's romantic life had some twists and turns. He was involved with Constantia Gladkowska in Warsaw and later became engaged to Maria Wodzi\u0144ska in Dresden, but broke off the relationship before they married. However, in 1836, he met novelist Aurore Dudevant, famously known by her pseudonym, George Sand. Two years later, Chopin accompanied Sand and her children to the island of Majorca, but the vacation took a turn when the musician became ill. The group moved to Marseille where doctors diagnosed Chopin with tuberculosis.After three months, Chopin made a full recovery, and he and Sand planned their return to Paris. But first, they spent the summer of 1839 at Sand's country house. They returned to the home every summer over the next seven years, a period that many say was \"the happiest and most productive of Chopin's life.\" During his time in the country, Chopin composed some of his greatest masterpieces.However, by the mid-1940s, Chopin and Sand's relationship fell apart, and his health declined again. Following their breakup, he toured the British Isles, and the fast-paced schedule appeared to take a toll on him and his behavior became \"erratic,\" possibly due to an undiagnosed form of epilepsy. He made his last public appearance on Nov. 16, 1848, and returned to Paris, where he died at age 39 on Oct. 17, 1849.\"Chopin did not live just for his own pleasure or fame, but to the end of his difficult and sickness-ridden life he strived to communicate the unique language of his romantic soul to others,\" Yoder says. \"Chopin well understood his calling as a composer. He understood that even his sickness could help him better express the depth of emotion in his pieces.\"Chopin's body was buried at P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery, but his heart was interred at a Warsaw church, near his birthplace. There is still a fair amount of mystery surrounding the circumstances of his death, but in his short life, Chopin made a lasting mark on the world of arts and culture, and his legacy continues to be celebrated by musicians and audiences alike.If you are unfamiliar with the music of Chopin and would like somewhere to start, this performance by Vadim Chaimovich of his Nocturne Op. 9 No. 1 is a good place to begin:He may have been a renowned child prodigy-turned-adult superstar, but Chopin was apparently very shy and preferred to play piano in the dark throughout his entire career. Before beginning a performance, he blew out the candles in the room and often asked his hosts to extinguish any light."},

While many people may be familiar with this Christopher Marlowe line from \"Doctor Faustus,\" they may not be as familiar with his inspiration: Helen of Troy. Otherwise known as Helene or Helen of Sparta, the mythological figure is a character in Homer's epic poem, \"The Iliad,\" who is described as the most beautiful woman of Greece. She's also been blamed for inadvertently sparking the Trojan War (which some might say is unfair considering the fault really lies with the men fighting over her). But there's much more to Helen than many realize, and her story is one more piece of the fascinating, interconnected puzzle of Greek mythology.Like many players in Greek mythology, Helen's family life is a little complicated. \"The most important part of Helen's bio \u2014 aside from the fact that she was the immediate reason for the Trojan War being fought \u2014 is that she's the daughter of the chief god Zeus,\" says Richard P. Martin, Antony and Isabelle Raubitschek professor in classics at California's Stanford University, in an email interview. \"Her mother was a mortal, Leda, who was married to Tyndareus of Sparta.\" According to Martin, Zeus \u2014 a master of disguise \u2014 took on the form of a swan to seduce Leda and she produced two eggs, resulting in four offspring: the girls Helen and Clytemnestra, and the boys Castor and Polydeuces (better known by their Latin names Castor and Pollux \u2014 the \"Gemini\" or twins). \"Helen and her sister grew up to marry two brothers, Menelaus and Agamemnon, respectively,\" Martin says.Helen's history as an important mythological figure runs deep. \"Helen was worshipped as a goddess in Sparta in historical times,\" Martin says. \"She was especially associated with springs of water and trees. Rituals carried out by girls nearing the age of marriage were dedicated to her.\"AdvertisementSo why is Helen implicated in the start of the Trojan War, the legendary Bronze Age conflict between the early Greeks and the people of Troy? Experts still debate which portions of the war were based in reality and which were fabricated by creatives like Homer and Virgil. So how does Helen fit into the most popular version of the story?\"Helen was the most beautiful woman in Greece and had many suitors,\" Martin says. \"Her father made them all swear that they would come to the aid of whichever suitor won Helen's hand in marriage, should anything happen to her. He chose Menelaus to be her husband. The pair lived in Sparta and had a daughter, Hermione.\"According to Martin, while Helen and Menelaus started their domestic life together, a young prince from Troy on the other side of Aegean Sea named Paris was asked to judge a beauty contest among the goddesses: Hera (Zeus's wife), Athena and Aphrodite.\"Each promised success in her own special field,\" Martin says. \"Hera offered rule as a king, Athena offered wisdom, and Aphrodite dangled Helen as a bribe \u2014 and of course Paris proceeded to judge the sex goddess to be the fairest.\"Martin says that when Paris went to visit Menelaus, he seduced Helen and sailed back with her to Troy, prompting the leading warriors of Greece (who, had until recently, been the ones vying for Helen's attention) to join Agamemnon and Menelaus in taking her back from Paris. \"But he would not let her go, and so a ten-year siege of Troy by the Greeks began, ending only with the ruse of the Trojan Horse that enabled the Greek fighters to secretly enter the citadel and set it aflame,\" Martin says. \"Menelaus finally got his wife back when the Greeks conquered the city.\"AdvertisementAs far as that famous line about her face, Martin explains how Helen came to be defined by a 17th century literary description. It refers to the Greek fleet that went in pursuit of Helen, and it comes from a line in a play called \"The Tragical History of Dr. Faustus,\" published in 1604 by a contemporary of Shakespeare named Christopher Marlowe,\" he says. \"The main character, Faustus, wants power at all costs and makes a deal with an associate of the devil, that he will sell his soul provided he is given the service of evil spirits for 24 hours. So he gets the ability to summon spirits of the long-dead, the most impressive being Helen of Troy, whom he takes as a lover.\"For further context, here are the lines with which Faustus greets Helen:But while Helen is often known for her role in Greek mythology, she has universal appeal. \"The story of Helen has deep connections with a folktale plot that is found all over the world, starting in ancient Egypt \u2014 the 'beautiful wife abducted,'\" Martin says. \"There is a terrific recent book on all the many versions, written by Lowell Edmunds: \"Stealing Helen: The Myth of the Abducted Wife in Comparative Perspective.\"HowStuffWorks may earn a small commission from affiliate links in this article.The mainstream version of Helen's story at the center of Homer's work is largely considered the most popular depiction of her narrative. But according to Martin, a sixth century B.C.E. version of her tale is quite different and involves the gods sending \"a kind of clone of Helen \u2014 a ghostly image or eidolon, appearing to be the real thing \u2014 to Troy in her place.\" He says that while the clone went off to Troy, \"the real Helen sat out the war in Egypt, where she had stopped over during her original voyage out of Sparta\" and that this version was \"given a comic twist by the radical playwright Euripides in his drama titled \"Helen,\" produced in Athens in 412 B.C.E.\""},

In spite of plagues and famines that ravaged the population in the 13th and 14th centuries, tens of thousands of people would walk for months to end up at the Santiago de Compostela cathedral in northwest Spain each year to pay their respects, receive absolution or pray for healing at the tomb of the apostle James. There were many more holy sites of varying popularity \u2014 the Seven Pilgrimage Churches of Rome and the Holy Land route (Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Nazareth) were the big time, but the church also encouraged pilgrimages to smaller shrines, like the tomb of Thomas Becket in the English county of Kent, the destination of the ragtag band of pilgrims depicted in Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales.\"No matter the distance, it was an accomplishment, hoofing it over hundreds or thousands of miles to arrive at a holy site, so naturally medieval pilgrims would want a souvenir to prove they had made the trek, to signal they belonged to a specific religious community and to serve as a sort of protective talisman. AdvertisementAs a result, an industry emerged to satisfy the pilgrims: Badges made out of a tin-lead alloy that they could pin to their hat or cloak were mass-produced and became wildly popular. Most of these badges depicted what you're probably imagining: saints being martyred, angels, animals with religious significance, pilgrims emerging victorious and spiritually cleansed from the pilgrimage site, etc. But some of them were a little more ... secular.Take, for instance, the badge depicting a giant vulva with arms and legs and a hat, holding a staff adorned with an erect phallus. Or the three phalluses manning a sailboat, or the winged, crowned phallus wearing a bell around its \"neck\" or the vulva on horseback, hunting with a bow and arrow. Honestly, there are so many different sexual motifs, and they're so bizarre and fascinating that it's easy to just ogle them without questioning why they were made in the first place.But most scholars studying medieval pilgrimage badges have a surprising theory for the purpose of such bawdy images: These badges were specifically made to ward off plague. The Black Death, which killed 25 million Europeans during this period, was terrifying in part because this was long before the germ theory of disease revolutionized the way we kept diseases from spreading. Nobody really knew how everyone was getting the plague \u2014 it was just as feasible that bad air or an imbalance in somebody's humours was the culprit as it was that sick people were passing it along to their friends just by looking at them. It was probably this last one \u2014 the sickly looks \u2014 that the lewd badges were trying to fend off.Although it's impossible to say exactly what the medieval pilgrims were thinking with these ridiculous and obscene pins, many scholars suggest that they were almost certainly not intended to be erotic. At the time, a virulent illness and an evil spirit were considered extremely close relatives, if not one and the same. Protective talismans like the Evil Eye have been used since ancient times to ward off the unwelcome and ill-intentioned stares of others, and images of genitalia have similarly been thought to have potent protective powers in cultures all over the world.Regardless of whether medieval pilgrims were correct or not about the method of disease transmission, the image of a lion with a giant phallus in its jaws pinned to somebody's lapel would probably make you look away from that person pretty quickly.\"Apotropaic\" is a word describing the ability of an image to turn away bad spirits."},

Artist: Henry Gillard Glindoni. "], "date": "Feb 17, 2021", "content": "The visually decadent hit show \"Bridgerton\" has managed to take some of the edge off and provide sweet relief from this world full of social unrest, pandemics and scurrilous politicians. Set in 1813 London during the oh-so-romantic Regency period, \"Bridgerton\" quickly wrecked previous Netflix viewership records, with 82 million households worldwide tuning in during its first four weeks of release. That's a stunning 41 percent of Netflix's subscriber base.No doubt, people tuned in because they heard tales of the diverse and gorgeous cast. All the sex scenes didn't hurt, either. But hot lovin' isn't all that \"Bridgerton\" is about. Feminist themes permeate throughout the first season, and the show also shines a bright light on class issues that plague society still today.Still, \"Bridgerton\" is a fictional television show based on an equally fictional book series, so it's safe to say that some creative liberties were taken. So, what did \"Bridgerton\" get right and wrong, historically speaking? Is it a true representation of life in Regency England? We take a closer look.AdvertisementExecutive producer Shonda Rhimes is known for shattering ceilings and stereotypes, so it really shouldn't have shocked anyone that she cast a smoldering Black man as a duke. Sadly for those fans of Simon Basset (also known as the Duke of Hastings), this scenario would have been very unlikely in Regency England.\"Bridgerton is largely a fantasy in terms of the diversity of the population shown,\" explains Regency historian Whitney S. Christiansen in an email. Only about 20,000 of the 1.3 million people in London at that time were Black, or about 1.5 percent of the population, she adds. \"The majority of them were poor or working class, with most employed as servants.\"There are some exceptions, however. \"While the numbers of high-ranking Black people in Bridgerton is fantasy, some of the ways they are depicted are based in fact,\" Christiansen says. \"Black boxers like Bill Richmond and Tom Molineaux were a popular form of entertainment, much like Hastings' friend Will. Additionally, interracial marriage, while rare, did happen and was depicted in the literature of the time.\"Let us also not forget that Queen Charlotte herself is portrayed in the show by a Black actress. This may very well be rooted in fact. \"One of her ancestors may very well have been a 'Moor,' or Black, a mistress of one of her ancestors. Portraits of her definitely illustrate an African cast to her features, including her curly hair,\" Christiansen explains. However, \"there were almost 500 years between Queen Charlotte and the Moorish mistress that may have been her ancestor; in that time, almost all the royalty in Europe was also related to the same woman, which would mean that they were equally as Black.\"AdvertisementWatch any period drama and you'll likely wind up incensed by the portrayal of women's rights (or lack thereof). \"Bridgerton\" does a great job of depicting a close representation of the rights of women of the day, Christiansen says.Whereas most of the female characters obsess over finding a husband, the character of Eloise Bridgerton routinely laments her gender's societally imposed limitations in life. \"Must our only options be to squawk and settle or to never leave the nest?,\" she says in one scene. \"You wish to follow your heart, and I wish to nurture my mind,\" she explains in another.The thing is, the women depicted who worry over finding a husband do so for good reason. In that time period, \"Women could typically not inherit, and in fact many estates were tied up in 'entailments,' which meant that upon the deaths of their fathers, their homes were inherited by the nearest male relative, sometimes leaving unmarried women homeless,\" Christiansen says. \"This made marriage incredibly important, because there was no real way to support yourself financially if you were not of the working class.\"Hence, the \"The London Season,\" which during the Regency period ran from around Easter to the end of the summer. During this time the debutantes \"came out\" at Queen Charlotte's Ball, a tradition that continues today. During the Regency period this marked the beginning of a months-long process of lavish balls, where men and women considered each other for marriage potential. \"The hunt for a husband was indeed known as the 'marriage mart,' and people did indeed track how many times you had danced with a specific partner, and particularly if they were in a row! Three times in one night meant you were practically engaged already!\" Christiansen notes.Many young women felt immense pressure to find a husband immediately, as the character of Daphne Bridgerton does. \"There is some truth in the idea that a failure to find a husband in your first season was a disaster, but it's not because of your reputation,\" Christiansen explains. \"It's more that the money spent on a successful season \u2014 the gowns, the carriages, the travel expenses, the balls hosted in one's own home \u2014 could be ruinous if they didn't pay off. The pressures on Daphne to make a good match would have been very real.\"AdvertisementIn the area of costumes, the show took some liberties, although the fashions are rooted in reality. \"These are mostly fantasy, with the designers taking the silhouettes from the era and playing with color and creativity for effect,\" Christiansen notes. \"The silhouette of Daphne's gowns is largely accurate. Regency Era gowns were inspired by Greek sculpture, as the Parthenon marbles were moved to London during this time, and so neoclassical ideals were all the rage.\"The Featherington ladies, in particular, sport brightly hued frocks. However, \"the use of color in Bridgerton is much more madcap than the reality would have been,\" Christiansen explains.Detail-oriented viewers might also note that Queen Charlotte and her courtiers are outfitted in a much different style, more suited to the Georgian aesthetic. \"This is accurate, because court dress remained several decades behind fashionable dress, with large hoops being worn until 1820,\" Christiansen says.AdvertisementAs with most films, books and TV shows set in pervious times, \"Bridgerton\" presents as a double-edged sword of sorts. \"For example, those who take Bridgerton's version of history as truth may fail to understand the deep racism that marked early 19th century London, including how its depictions of Black men as boxers or Marina as sexually experienced may actually reinforce racist stereotypes rather than challenge them,\" Christiansen explains. However, she adds, \"'Fantasy history' can also be a powerful way to get people interested in real history \u2014 it's often the pretty dresses and romance and charismatic characters that draw us in to discovering the real-life facts behind these people and places. It's a great marketing campaign that can lead to real scholarship.\"Internet searches about embroidery have skyrocketed by 86 percent since \"Bridgerton\" launched, breathing new life into this classic skill.

Nowadays, presidential inaugurations in the U.S. take place on Jan. 20 and include parades, speeches and several sedate balls. Nothing like Andrew Jackson's inauguration, when complete mayhem allegedly broke out in 1829. American presidential inaugurations used to be held in March, a full four months after the election. On March 4, 1829, a crowd estimated in the tens of thousands descended on Washington, D.C., to witness Andrew Jackson take the oath of office on the portico of the Capitol. The white-haired war hero known as \"Old Hickory\" gave a speech (which nobody could hear), kissed the Bible and bowed to the adoring throng.Jackson was America's first populist president, a straight-talking \"outsider\" candidate who vowed to represent the people, not the Washington elite. (He was the first president to win by appealing to the masses.) When the inauguration ceremony was over, the crowd broke through the barriers and rushed up the Capitol steps to shake hands with \"the peoples' president.\"\"The living mass was impenetrable,\" wrote Margaret Bayard Smith, a Washington socialite and author. \"Country men, farmers, gentlemen, mounted and dismounted, boys, women and children, black and white. Carriages, wagons and carts all pursuing him to the President's house.\"But what happened next is the only thing that most Americans know about Jackson's inauguration. Following a tradition established by George Washington, Jackson held a \"levee\" back at the White House, an \"open house\" of sorts where regular citizens could mingle with the new First Family. And that's when things allegedly got out of control. Way out of control.\"This is the iconic event that everybody knows about today, when thousands of people \u2014 'dirty' people with mud on their boots who, according to the genteel, should not have been there \u2014 stormed the White House and created total chaos,\" says Daniel Feller, an emeritus history professor at the University of Tennessee and editor of The Papers of Andrew Jackson. \"People standing on chairs to get a better view, grabbing for food and drinks to the point that tables are overturned and being shattered. This is the story that you've probably heard.\"AdvertisementFor almost two centuries, Andrew Jackson's inauguration blowout has been cited as the wildest party ever thrown at the White House, but historians like Feller believe we should take the colorful accounts with a grain of salt, if not a 5-pound bag of it.The most vivid descriptions of the melee at Jackson's levee were nearly all based on the writings of one person: Margaret Bayard Smith, the socialite and prolific letter-writer quoted above. Far from being a witness, Smith actually showed up late to the March 4 party, long after the events she described had allegedly taken place. Feller also notes that Smith was not a fan of Jackson's populist politics, which undoubtedly colored her opinion of the day's events.\"I don't want to undercut this too much,\" says Feller. \"I don't think Smith would have made it up out of whole cloth. But you have to recognize that her account is basically the only one that portrays what happened at the White House in such extreme terms. It's not an eyewitness account, and it's very likely a jaundiced account.\"Reading Smith's account of Jackson's inauguration day, it's easy to understand why so many contemporary newspapers and later historians jumped on the story of how Jackson's uncouth rabble ransacked the White House and almost trampled the president to death. In a letter to her daughter, Smith wrote of the majesty and pomp of the inaugural itself and how her visit to the White House had been delayed by rumors of overwhelming crowds. Sometime after 3 p.m., she and her crew finally made it to the party.\"But what a scene did we witness!\" wrote Smith. \"The Majesty of the People had disappeared, and a rabble, a mob, of boys, negros [sic], women, children, scrambling, fighting, romping. What a pity what a pity!\"You can almost hear Smith clutching her pearls at the scene she found at the White House, where previous presidents had always opened their doors to the public, but not this kind of public, surely.\"Among people like Smith, if you go to the White House, you should be presentable, gentlemanly or ladylike,\" says Feller. \"And to her, there were clearly some people at Jackson's levee who didn't look like they belonged there. How much of that was her perception and how much was reality? Undoubtedly some of both.\"Smith reported that the crowd at the White House was estimated at 20,000 people, although she admitted, \"I think the number exaggerated.\" She didn't hesitate, though, to pass along secondhand accounts of women fainting, men \"seen with bloody noses\" and expensive glassware \"to the amount of several thousand dollars\" broken in the mad rush for refreshments.AdvertisementOf course, Smith wasn't the only attendee of Jackson's inaugural to write about the experience. Daniel Webster, then a senator from Massachusetts, was also no fan of Jackson's politics, but he came away with a different opinion of the \"monstrous crowd of people\" who descended upon the city.\"I never saw anything like it before,\" wrote Webster. \"Persons have come 500 miles to see General Jackson and they really seem to think that the Country is rescued from some dreadful danger.\"Instead of describing the inaugural audience as uncivilized rabble, though, as Smith had, Webster blamed the crush of humanity on \"thousands of expectants for office who throng the City, & clamor all over the Country.\"In Webster's eyes, the impressive crowds at Jackson's inaugural weren't just members of the president's adoring public, but also political aspirants looking for a cushy government job with the new administration.\"Throwing 'office-seeker' into the mix undercuts the idea that the outpouring of people into Washington was somehow pure and noble and un-self-interested,\" says Feller, who also thinks it's notable that in Webster's long description of the day's events, he doesn't even mention the allegedly shameful party. \"If it had been that riotous scene that Smith reports, you'd think [Webster] would have mentioned it.\"It should be noted that Smith's account, while widely quoted, isn't the only evidence that something ugly may have happened at the White House on March 4, 1829.Newspapers functioned differently in the early 1800s, explains Feller. In a \"small town\" like Washington, D.C., it was expected that everyone would already know the local news, so city papers were usually stuffed with national or international headlines. That explains why the Washington papers didn't waste ink on the inaugural party, but why one of the most colorful accounts showed up a week later in the New York Spectator.\"Here was the corpulent epicure grunting and sweating for breath,\" wrote the Spectator, \"the dandy wishing he had no toes, the tight-laced Miss, fearing her person might receive some permanently deforming impulse, the miser hunting for his pocket-book, the courtier looking for his watch, and the office-seeker in an agony to reach the President.\"In 1978, the Tennessee Historical Society dug up a few more contemporary accounts of the infamous inaugural bash for one of Tennessee's most famous sons. \"Sheer bedlam\" was how the Historical Society characterized the party at the White House. Rep. Charles Miner from Pennsylvania offered a description that may have been the inspiration for Smith's own account.\"Orange punch by barrels-full was made,\" wrote Miner, \"but as the waiters opened the door to bring it out, a rush would be made, the glasses broken, the pails of liquor upset, and the most painful confusion prevailed. To such a degree was this carried, that wine and ice-creams could not be brought out to the ladies. . .\" Miner was also shocked to see \"men, with boots heavy with mud, standing on the damask satin-covered chairs, from their eagerness to get a sight of the President.\"It's clear from these corroborating accounts that lots and lots of people showed up at the White House on inauguration day, some to shake Old Hickory's hand, some to ask him for a job, and some presumably to get free punch and ice cream. Indeed the crush forced Jackson to retreat to the National Hotel for his safety. But was it the carnival that Smith so dramatically described or an overblown legend that fits a convenient political stereotype? Sen. James Hamilton of South Carolina, who was a Jackson supporter, described the inaugural event as a \"regular Saturnalia,\" but added that most of the damage was minimal.\"You might be surprised at how often this happens with history,\" says Feller. \"One particular quotation or anecdote gets picked up as being absolute truth, then it becomes of much greater importance than it was at the time, because it just seems to fit.\"White House inaugural receptions continued for several decades after the Jackson debacle until afternoon inaugural parades created scheduling conflicts. President George H.W. Bush revived the idea in 1989 with a \"White House American Welcome,\" inviting the public to the White House the day after his inauguration. "},

It runs from the open country near the Indiana state line to the heavily forested and rugged shoreline near the Straits of Mackinac in the far north.It is for the most part a low, flat coastline, with periodic river and stream outlets. Sandy dune fields and clay bluffs rise now and then, and the land becomes more hilly to the north.Major hazards to mariners include sandy shallows, mud shoals, and offshore rock reefs. Nowhere along that coast is there a more important lighthouse than at Holland Harbor, also known as Black Lake.Traditionally, commerce on Lake Michigan proceeded north and south in shipping lanes that were parallel to the coast. Thus, from the beginning, a system of lighthouses was built that prominently lit the coasts. The light at Holland Harbor was, and still is, an integral part of that important coastal navigational system.Ships headed south toward Gary and Chicago depend on the light at Holland Harbor to keep them on course -- and well away from the Michigan coast and its dangerous submerged limestone reefs and sandbars.Known as \"Big Red,\" the current Holland Harbor Lighthouse was built during the Great Depression, in 1936, and sits at the end of a long pier. It is a sizable structure, rising five stories above the pier, and is painted cherry red to increase its visibility to mariners out on the lake.The building is also covered with steel plates to protect it from the ice and waves of the winter storms.

It spread quickly through unclean water and unwashed hands, leading to symptoms like nausea, fatigue, fever and a stiffening of the body.The summers especially caused surges in infections, particularly around the swimming holes, leading to post-polio paralysis and, in some cases, death. On average, 35,000 people were disabled each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt was among the most notable people to get the condition, putting a face to a still uncertain disease.AdvertisementA vaccine was desperately needed as scientists learned about the transmission process, including the fact that anyone could be a carrier. In the next few years, rival scientists Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin worked with teams in their labs on two completely different vaccines. Sabin worked on an oral vaccine while Salk created an injectable vaccine using a \"killed\" version of polio.In his book \"Polio: An American Story,\" David M. Oshinsky writes about the urgency of Salk's work during this time:From the very beginning of the polio epidemic, monkeys were considered to be essential for research before human trials could take place, becoming the unsung heroes of the fight to defeat the disease. It was through animal research that scientists first discovered that there were three strains of the deadly disease.The monkeys were purchased, at a high cost, from India and the Philippines and shipped to the United States. Many died in transit so the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, now known as the March of Dimes, began overseeing their import. In 1949, a foundation established a special facility known as Okatie Farms in rural South Carolina to process the monkeys arriving from abroad, according to Oshinsky.AdvertisementOkatie Farms operated in the Pinckney Colony area of Beaufort County in coastal South Carolina. Originally called the Pritchardville Primate Center, the 40-acre (16-hectare) tract of land along the river was called the \"Ellis Island for thousands of monkeys from India\" by local newspapers.Naturalist John Hamlet had the job of finding a space for the primate center that was both connected to deep water ports and airports but also remote enough from neighbors. The area he chose closely approximated the natural habitats of the monkeys with its abundance of shady longleaf pines and a mild climate.The monkeys were originally brought into Savannah, Georgia, one of the region's biggest ports, and taken by truck the 30-odd miles (48 kilometers) to the farm. When air travel became more popular, they were flown via London and New York before traveling by train to the Low Country.Once they arrived at the farm, veterinarians treated the 2,000 or so rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys before clearing them for transport to research facilities around the country. The monkeys spent 21 days getting acclimated and eating a special diet with scientists carefully monitoring their status. Many went to Salk's facility in Pittsburgh and Sabin's in Ann Arbor where they were injected with vaccines to test their strength against the three polio viruses.Few locals were aware of the research that was going on at the farm, despite rumors of people encountering the animals. We were unable to discover any opposition to the research facility, perhaps because it was not well-known and also because opposition to using animals in testing was not very common. In the U.S., the movement against animal testing picked up steam around 1980.\"Not until much later did I hear about Pinckney Colony [the community where Okatie was located] and the 'Monkey Farm' from some friends who had lived there,\" says David M. Taub, the former mayor of Beaufort and a former scientist at the nearby Morgan Island research facility.AdvertisementBut the farm's purpose wasn't permanent. Once Salk's polio vaccine was deemed a success and released to the public in 1955, the work of Okatie Farms was no longer necessary, and the facility closed in 1959. (Sabin's oral vaccine came into use in 1961.) The foundation that had established the facility turned its attention to reducing premature births. The monkeys found new homes in labs across the country.According to a former employee named Louise Crawford, things at the farm were just left as they were, including the monkey cages. A caretaker kept the grass and plant life at bay. The lab was locked up, ready for someone new to take on the important task of preparing monkeys for research. But that day never came.In 1980, the land and its contents were sold to a development group. The lab equipment was donated to a local school's science department while a farmer claimed the former monkey cages for his own animals. Today the acreage along the Okatie River is mostly residential and privately owned. Thanks to Salk's and Sabin's vaccines, polio cases have plummeted from 350,000 in 1988 to 22 in 2017, according to the World Health Organization.HowStuffWorks earns a small affiliate commission when you purchase through links on our site.While using monkeys in medical research is controversial for some, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which White House Coronavirus Task Force expert Dr. Anthony Fauci is the director of, uses primates in their labs around the country in its fight to develop treatments and a vaccine for COVID-19."},

Some of them never, ever leave.Millions of people enter the grounds of P\u00e8re Lachaise in Paris each year. Some of them never, ever leave.It is, after all, one of the most famous cemeteries in the world \u2013 and although it's strongly linked to death, P\u00e8re Lachaise is perhaps better known for its great beauty and the incredible demand for its few burial spaces.Its grounds hold fast some of the most famous people ever to walk the planet. As such \u2013 much like a VIP-only nightclub \u2013 anybody who's anyone in Paris wants to be buried there. Yet, no matter how deep your earthly bank account might be, you still might not be able to score a posthumous spot in this ultra-popular burial ground.After all, P\u00e8re Lachaise is no ordinary cemetery. Like the city around it, it's a blend of immaculate cleanliness and elderly dilapidation, legend and lore.\"Established by Napoleon in 1804, P\u00e8re Lachaise is Paris's largest cemetery, consisting of more than 100 acres (40 hectares) and over 1,000,000 internments,\" says Keith Eggener, a professor at the University of Oregon who is known in part for his expertise on cemetery architectural history. \"Among those buried here are many notable figures, particularly writers, painters, musicians, actors, and performers.\"The cemetery takes its name from King Louis XIV's confessor, Father Fran\u00e7ois d'Aix de La Chaise. The cemetery's illustrious list of permanent residents includes Oscar Wilde, Gertrude Stein, Federic Chopin, Moli\u00e8re, Marcel Proust, Colette, Jacques-Louis David, Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Georges Seurat, \u00c9dith Piaf, Sarah Bernhardt, Isadora Duncan, Yves Montand and Marcel Marceau.AdvertisementEggener says that P\u00e8re Lachaise is frequently called the first garden or landscape cemetery, based on the picturesque gardens built at many 18th-century English aristocratic country-houses, with irregular, winding paths and a seemingly random, naturalistic approach to plantings.It's an approach that differed wildly from earlier cemeteries.\"P\u00e8re Lachaise served as a turning point between the old, overcrowded medieval churchyards, where bodies had been piled atop each other for centuries, and the new garden cemetery movement,\" says author Loren Rhoads, who has written extensively about cemeteries.\"When the cemetery was opened in 1803, it stood at the edge of Paris. It was huge compared to the churchyards. Families could purchase burial space where they could be buried together, as opposed to the churchyards, where each person was buried as they fell and families were not only buried separately, but survivors had no idea where in the churchyard their loved ones might lie.\"Rhoads points out that P\u00e8re Lachaise was not immediately popular, in part because it was so difficult for people to reach. But the newly created necropolis wouldn't die easily.\"The cemetery founders decided they needed to have a gimmick to pull in the paying customers, so they found a body reputed to be Moliere's and buried it with lots of fanfare, then reunited the medieval lovers Abelard and Heloise in a shared grave,\" she says.Moliere, a great writer and actor, died in 1673, and remains known as one of the greatest playwriters to ever live. Abelard and Heloise were a star-crossed couple whose transcendent love letters enamored them to countless people around the world.What began in Paris did not stay in Paris.Eggener says that P\u00e8re Lachaise's informal layout was a major inspiration to U.S.-based landscape designers of the mid-19th century, including those behind the Rural Cemetery Movement, the first urban public parks, and the first elite suburban subdivisions.AdvertisementThese days, P\u00e8re Lachaise is a major tourist attraction, less of a graveyard and more of a museum. Nearly 4 million people visit these hallowed grounds every year to witness its majesty.One of the most popular headstones is that of the Lizard King himself,  Jim Morrison, the lead singer of The Doors, who died in Paris at the age of 27 in 1971. His grave has been the repository of countless trinkets (legal and otherwise), and overeager fans have torn off bits of the area, including nearby graves, as mementos of the poet-singer who was famous in part for penning a death-laced song titled \u2013 aptly \u2013 \"The End.\"But for most of the people who enter these grounds, P\u00e8re Lachaise isn't the end. Nor is it just a cemetery. It's a reflection of the Parisians who crafted and perfected its artfully imperfect approach to the afterlife.\"One of the things I've always found most intriguing about the place is its distinctly urban quality \u2013 its named, cobblestone streets densely lined with little stone tomb-houses, its cast-iron street furniture, its division into neighborhoods, and even its socio-spatial segregation (e.g., separate areas for Christians, Muslims and Jews),\" says Eggener.He adds that, \"A true necropolis, P\u00e8re Lachaise is indeed the double, or the reverse, of the living city that it serves.\"AdvertisementP\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery is located at 16 rue du Repos. The best way to get there is to take the No. 2 or No. 3 M\u00e9tro line; get off at the P\u00e8re-Lachaise stop and walk down the street \u2013 you can't miss it. The cemetery is open weekdays from 8 a.m.-5:30 p.m., Saturdays from 8:30 a.m.-5:30 p.m., and Sundays from 9 a.m.-5:30 p.m. (open until 6 p.m. in the summer). There is no admission fee.Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, from Novemer 6, 2020 to March 15, 2021, the cemetery is only open to those living within one kilometer (0.6 miles) of the grounds. Check the website for further information and updates.P\u00e8re Lachaise features a heart-wrenching section in remembrance of World War II, filled with monuments for victims of the Holocaust. \"The sculptures are huge, brutal, and beautiful, thought-provoking and fierce,\" said Rhoads. \"The acknowledgment of all that France lost during the war seems very fitting amongst the graves of so many cultural icons. The juxtaposition of the remembered and the unknown is so striking. That section of P\u00e8re Lachaise is one of my favorite places in Paris.\""},

And while not all of them realize it, in many ways they take after a group of mid-19th century New England intellectuals such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and Margaret Fuller, among others, who espoused a philosophy known as transcendentalism.AdvertisementThe transcendentalist movement, which emerged in the mid-1830s, had a straightforward idea at its core. Its adherents argued that every person possessed the light of Divine truth and should look within himself or herself to find it, rather than simply conform to whatever the powers that be wanted them to think. But from that notion of spiritual self-reliance, a lot of other ideas blossomed, from reverence for nature to the view that everyone in America was entitled to freedom and equality. That led transcendentalists to become an important part of other activist movements in America that sought to abolish slavery and achieve women's suffrage.And though it was inspired in part by thinkers on the other side of the Atlantic, \"Transcendentalism became the first distinctly American philosophy, because it fused several different currents, all of which converged only here in the U.S.,\" Laura Dassow Walls explains in an email. She's the William P. and Hazel B. White Professor of English at the University of Notre Dame, and author of the acclaimed 2017 biography, \"Henry David Thoreau: A Life.\"\"So, even though the underlying philosophy first emerged in Europe, it was in America that it took hold as a philosophy one could actually commit to and live by,\" she says.AdvertisementAccording to Walls, one of transcendentalism's key influences was the religious faith of New England's Puritans, who believed that every person stands before God and must read the Bible for himself or herself. \"This gave us the bedrock notion of individualism,\" she says.Another important ingredient was the American Revolution, which promoted equality as an American ideal \u2014 even if the new country didn't actually afford that status to a lot of its people, including women and Blacks. \"The transcendentalists, whose parents had grown up fighting the Revolution, believed it was their turn to continue the Revolution, that is, to continue the political revolution by igniting it as an intellectual revolution,\" Walls says.Those ideas mixed together with another rising early 1880s influence \u2014 European Romanticism, a literary and artistic movement that emphasized feeling and emotion rather than the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and order.\"All through the war years \u2014 the American Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, the War of 1812 \u2014 Americans found it virtually impossible to go to Europe or even to access European books,\" Walls says. \"But after the Paris peace treaty of 1815, suddenly travel to Europe was wide open again. A whole generation of ambitious young American men sailed to Europe to continue their education at European universities, above all in Germany. The books and ideas and teachings they brought back with them \u2014 Kant, Goethe, the Humboldt brothers, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Byron and Shelley, and on and on \u2014 infused American colleges and universities with an exciting new wave of European literature and philosophy.\" It was \"a wave which swiftly spread into the popular imagination, inspiring a widespread confidence that a new age was born, an age in which the individual could intuit truth for him- or herself by an inward search for meaning.\"A small group interested in these ideas began meeting together in the mid-1830s, first at a hotel and then in the Boston home of a minister named George Ripley, forming what became known as the Transcendental Club. The group eventually published a magazine, The Dial, which was edited by Fuller.Later, some of the transcendentalists even created a short-lived utopian community in Boston based upon their ideas \u2014 Brook Farm, whose residents shared the agricultural work and operated a school.While the transcendentalists were a rebellious fringe, a lot of their ideas eventually became an accepted part of the American mainstream. \"As Emerson said, 'In self-trust, all the virtues are comprehended,'\" Walls explains. \"This notion of self-trust became the foundation for American self-reliance, another term coined by Emerson.\"AdvertisementThoreau, former schoolmaster turned poet and philosopher, bought into these ideas and endeavored to live them. As this article from the Constitutional Rights Foundation details, in 1845, he built a cottage on Walden Pond, on property owned by Emerson, and spent several years living off the land, meditating and contemplating nature. Thoreau stopped paying his taxes in protest against legal slavery in the U.S. and the U.S. war against Mexico in 1846. That led to him being arrested by the local constable for tax delinquency. He spent a night in jail before a benefactor paid off his debt. The experience led Thoreau to publish his influential essay \"Civil Disobedience,\" in which he argued that people should defy the government rather than support policies they saw as unjust.\"Let every man make known what kind of government would command his respect, and that will be one step toward obtaining it,\" Thoreau wrote.\"Thoreau gave us the classic examples \u2014 first in his uniquely individualist form of social protest, civil disobedience, and then in pursuing his Utopian search for truth by living in solitude at Walden Pond \u2014 striking out alone to 'enjoy an original relation to the universe' as Emerson said,\" Walls says. \"It's good to remember that this 'original relation' included the universe of human history \u2014 world literature, the world's religions, modern science, philosophy all the way back to the ancient Greeks, Plato above all \u2014 but also, famously, the universe of the outer world, or nature, which the transcendentalists regarded as the embodiment of divine reason, hence the key to universal meaning.\"According to Walls, the transcendentalists \"interpreted truth not as something that one could find, single and static, but as something one lived, dynamic and always evolving and changing.\"That unending search for the truth also led the movement's members to become activists in big causes of their day. The transcendentalist belief that every person carries God within him or her meant that politics, economics, organized religion and the schools, with their tendency to sort people into hierarchical ranks, needed to be overhauled or at least reformed.\"The American educational system was their first target \u2014 education should be free to all, of all ages, men and women alike, and all ethnicities, races and creeds,\" Walls says. \"Many of the transcendentalists were teachers, and several \u2014 Bronson Alcott, Elizabeth Peabody [and] Thoreau \u2014 founded innovative, progressive schools, which embraced literacy and education for everyone, including women and African Americans.\" Their ideas still influence education today.AdvertisementTranscendentalists also took up the fight against slavery \u2014 \"led, notably, by women, who took up the cause starting in the 1830s by founding anti-slavery societies at the local level and organizing anti-slavery activism at all levels, local, regional and national,\" Walls explains. Emerson and Thoreau gave speeches against slavery. Another transcendentalist minister, Theodore Parker, not only preached abolitionist sermons but actually formed a vigilance committee to protect free Blacks in Boston from southern slave-catchers. \"Thoreau daringly acted as a conductor on the Underground Railroad, and went on to inspire the northern movement in support of John Brown,\" Walls notes.Members of the movement also were early advocates of equality for women. Margaret Fuller's 1845 book \"Woman in the Nineteenth Century\" contained what for the time was a daring proclamation: \"What woman needs is not as a woman to act or rule, but as a nature to grow, as an intellect to discern, as a soul to live freely and unimpeded, to unfold such powers as were given her when we left our common home.\" Fuller's influence was felt a few years later in the Seneca Falls Convention, the 1848 conference that's widely recognized as the beginning of the women's rights movement.The transcendentalist movement eventually began to fade in prominence, but its ideas never really went away. In the 1960s and 1970s, for example, there was a resurgence of enthusiasm for Thoreau, as antiwar activists and hippies found that his ideas about resisting the power structure were relevant to them. Today, when climate activists argue that environmental protection and social justice for poor people and minority communities aren't separate issues but are actually inseparably linked, they're drawing upon Thoreau's belief that we need to get off the shoulders of others, Walls explains.\"Interest in Thoreau's ideas is stronger today than ever before; certainly students in my own classes resonate to his message more urgently than ever,\" Walls says. \"They identify with Thoreau's fear that we're living lives of 'quiet desperation,' and many respond with intense hope to the solutions he offers. For one reason, his is an individualist form of hope; you can take on his ethical project by yourself, on your own, no matter who you are or where you live. In other words, he offers a sense that even today we can exert at least some control over our lives, learn to live by a higher ethical standard and so at the least make our own lives better \u2014 a place to start the ethical project of making all lives better.\"Walden Pond, where Thoreau lived for two years, also was the place where Boston entrepreneur Frederic \"Ice King\" Tudor harvested ice, cutting blocks and shipping them to faraway countries, according to the New England Historical Society. \"Thus it appears that the sweltering inhabitants of Charleston and New Orleans, or Madras and Bombay and Calcutta, drink at my well,\" Thoreau wrote in 1854."},

After the fall of the dinosaurs, evolution decided to turn its laissez-faire attention to making miniature organisms like elephants.

One of the enchanting things about terrestrial dinosaurs, besides their weird horns, proportions and protuberances, is the fact that being freaking immense was pretty commonplace back in the late Cretaceous.But the discovery of a complete skeleton of one of these big guys is pretty much unheard of, so it's tough to know exactly which of the known prehistoric behemoths was the biggest. A good indication of the size of an animal is the size of its foot, if that's what you've got, and a new study out of the University of Queensland (UQ) describes a recently discovered dinosaur track found on the Dampier Peninsula on Australia's western coast that might belong to the biggest-ever terrestrial dino. If nothing else, it certainly had the biggest foot we know about.AdvertisementThe Dampier Peninsula is a spot archaeologists call \"Australia's Jurassic Park\" or the \"Cretaceous Serengeti\" because it's like the fossil remains of a dinosaur zoo. The prints of\u00a021 dinosaur\u00a0species, all from the same time period, have been discovered in the 15.5-mile (25-kilometer) site called Walmadany \u2014 that's the most dinosaur diversity ever found in one place. Thousands of tracks have been discovered, and 150 of them have been linked to specific species of dinosaurs: predators, armored dinosaurs, two-legged herbivorous ornithopods, and long-necked herbivorous sauropods. Walmandany is also home to the only confirmed stegosaur found in Australia.Last year a dino print was found in Mongolia's\u00a0Gobi Desert,\u00a0measuring in at 3.5 feet (106 centimeters) long and 2.5 feet (77 centimeters) wide, which researchers thought might hold the world record for biggest land dinosaur \u2014 it was more than 98 feet (30 meters) long and 66 feet (20 meters) tall. But the UQ researchers uncovered a print even bigger at Walmadany \u2014 a sauropod track more than 5.5 feet (1.7 meters) long, indicating the animal was probably around 17-18 feet (5.3-5.5 meters) tall at the hip. A giraffe could probably gaze only at this animal's rear end without having to look up.Nothing more is yet known about this animal, but Walmandany was included in the listing of the West Kimberley National Heritage Place in 2011 \u2014 an area that was once targeted for hosting a giant natural gas processing project \u2014 so though 400 hours have been spent by researchers studying these prints, the site will be protected for further study. This UQ video featuring paleontologist Steve Salisbury dives deeper into the recent discovery:The dinosaur tracks at Walmandany figure into a song cycle of the Goolarabooloo people, the traditional custodians of the area, thought to belong to Dreamtime creator named Marala, the Emu Man.

Singers Lynn Gunn and Sierra Kusterbeck got matching ones on their upper arms. And if you perform a quick Pinterest search for the phrase \"ouroboros tattoo,\" you'll find a seemingly never-ending scroll of images depicting a self-eating snake on just about every inch of skin imaginable. But what is an ouroboros and how did it become such a popular choice for those getting inked?Advertisement\"'Ouroboros' is a Greek word meaning 'tail-devouring,'\" Richard P. Martin, Antony and Isabelle Raubitschek professor in Classics at Stanford University, explains via email. While the image of a snake with its tail in its mouth can be found in tomb paintings and on small objects dating all the way back to the time of Tutankhamun, who reigned from 1333 to 1323 B.C.E., Martin says the ouroboros picked up steam in the era known as Late Antiquity \u2014 in this case, approximately the 4th or 5th centuries C.E.But even during this period, there were only a few abbreviated Greek and Latin allusions to the image. \"Maybe there was a continuous tradition passed down for those thousands of years in between, one transmitted from Egypt to Greece and Rome,\" Martin says. \"Most likely, what happened was a kind of guesswork by much later ancient people looking at much earlier pictures and speculating on what they meant. And the speculation still continues.\"Even the original Egyptian meaning of the ouroboros is hotly debated in academia, according to Martin, with some scholars arguing that the later interpretations were probably not what the original Egyptian contexts contained. So, in short, the origin of the self-eating snake is still somewhat ambiguous.Even though the ouroboros popped up in ancient Greece, Martin says the symbol is not a significant part of any specific myth and it's not directly associated with any particular god or goddess. \"It exists as a floating symbol, with no known story (besides what we might guess at concerning Egyptian associations,\" he says. \"This happens, although pretty rarely, in the realm of mythology. It's closer to the sort of handed-down ore and allegories attached to the legendary phoenix (also a tale first associated with Egypt).\"AdvertisementIf the origin of the ouroboros is a mystery, what it represents is even more of an enigma. \"What it originally symbolized is pretty much a matter of educated reconstructions \u2014 we don't know for sure,\" Martin says. \"Yet what it is taken to symbolize now ranges all over the place, from ideas of eternity to regeneration and destruction and even recycling.\"Martin says some speculate the ouroboros may have begun as a symbol for the Egyptian sun god, Ra. \"This complex of myths was extremely important as it connected with further beliefs about the nature of time and the cosmos, the rise and fall of the Nile, and life after death,\" he says. But there are also theories that ouroboros is tied to other Egyptian gods, like the sky goddess, Nut. \"In some pictures, where she is arched over almost into a circle and shown giving birth to the sun in the East and then consuming it at day's end, looks a bit like the ouroboros circling around the earth or around figures of divinities, in other depictions,\" Martin says. \"But the texts in Egyptian never explicitly say what is going on with this self-consuming snake.\"In the Western world, the ouroboros picked up popularity around the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance thanks to two particular traditions, Martin says: alchemy and emblems. \"The first was a body of semi-scientific lore and practices aimed at turning lower substances (like lead) into higher (like gold),\" he says. \"Alchemists adopted the ouroboros as the symbol of the nature of the universe. One of their dogmas was 'one is all'; in other words, all of nature is interconnected and interchangeable. So the wrap-around endless snake seemed fitting.\"Martin says that much of the ideas in alchemy leaned on semi-mystical interpretations of Plato's philosophy while Renaissance scholars also pulled from the school of Neoplatonic thought. \"One of them, Marsilio Ficino of Florence, in the 15th century refers to the Egyptian ouroboros as a symbol for the nature of time itself,\" Martin says. \"Pumping up the ouroboros boom, a few decades before Ficino's birth, an Italian traveler discovered in a Greek island monastery a manuscript about Egyptian hieroglyphs that was a distant copy of a treatise written in Greek by an author called Horapollo, who lived in the 5th century C.E. in Egypt. The manuscript was brought back to Florence (where it still remains). Horapollo claims that the ouroboros was one of these pictures in the Egyptian writing system, and that it meant 'world.'\"Symbolism played a major role in the Renaissance and Martin says people \"devoured so-called 'emblem' books that had just such tidbits of knowledge (and Aesop's fables and all kinds of other lore) printed alongside woodcuts of the objects or symbols being interpreted.\" Through these books, a much wider audience came to discover the ouroboros image and centuries later, psychologists like C.G. Jung ended up discussing the ouroboros as \"some sort of deep archetype in human consciousness,\" Martin says. \"But many of these meanings were just arbitrarily layered on through those years of earlier reception of an enigmatic autophagous ('self-eating') snake.\"Although the symbol itself remains a mystery in so many ways, the ouroboros is still a modern star, even outside the tattoo parlor. \"The ouroboros is big nowadays,\" Martin says. \"Cryptographers have named a brand of eternally-secure 'blockchain' protocols after it and it's the title of an award-winning play by Tom Jacobson from 2008.\"And as for its popularity among the tattoo community? Oakland ink artist and owner of OTattoo Studio, Sirimontra (aka @avantgarde.ink on Instagram), says she understands the fascination. \"It's a frequent image that many have a connection with,\" she says via email. \"A symbol of renewal and rebirth much like moths or Phoenix. I decided instead of giving my studio name, it would be a circle, to represent the cycle of life and faith in its process, there is nothing to rise above if nothing to rise against. It is a world of chaos that need all of its ever-changing personalities to make up the physical experience.\"HowStuffWorks may earn a small commission from affiliate links in this article.While the ouroboros is often pictured as a snake, it can also take the form of a dragon devouring its own tail.

But no amount of dust could obscure the hotel's lustrous history \u2013 because \"the Chelsea,\" as it's often called, has been a home to a veritable encyclopedia of cultural icons..Mark Twain, Stanley Kubrick, Arthur Miller, Jack Kerouac, Bob Dylan, Leonard Cohen, Nico, Patti Smith, Sam Shepard, Mitch Hedberg, Charles R. Jackson, and Dennis Hopper, among many others, all stayed there at one time or another. Some for a short time, others for years. Robert Mapplethorpe, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Dee Dee Ramone \u2013 the list of stars goes on and on.AdvertisementOf the Chelsea, Patti Smith wrote in her memoir \"Just Kids,\" \"I loved this place, its shabby elegance, and the history it held so possessively.\"But what is it about this hotel \u2013 of all the hotels in New York City \u2013 that gives it so much gravitational pull for artists of all kinds?Turns out, it was designed for exactly this purpose.\"It was initially built by Philip Hubert as an affordable artist's co-operative (though it was quickly taken over by upper and middle-class New Yorkers) and only later reopened as a hotel,\" emails Nicolaia Rips, an author who wrote about her experiences of growing up in the hotel in the 2000s. \"If you believe that you imbue the things you create with purpose, which I do, then it is very simple: art is in the hotel's foundation, it is as essential to the hotel as the brick and mortar.\"It was Hubert, a founder of the architectural firm of Hubert, Pirsson & Company, who brought the Chelsea to life in the mid-1880s. He was an avid follower of Charles Fourier, a French philosopher who imagined various forms of utopian socialism. More specifically, Fourier was a steadfast proponent of so-called \"intentional communities,\" in which teamwork and shared social values are top priorities.In designing and building the Hotel Chelsea, Hubert wanted just that \u2013 a place where people from varied backgrounds and lifestyles would feel safe in sharing their lives in the spirit of collaboration.\"To my knowledge, it's the largest and longest-lived artists' community in the history of the world,\" says Sherill Tippins, author of, \"Inside the Dream Palace: The Life and Times of New York's Legendary Chelsea Hotel.\"This vision was a grand success, as evidenced by the incredible number and variety of people who've called the Chelsea home at one time or another. And although the hotel is famous for its celebrities, regular types live there, too.\"The mix of types of residents provides fodder for art \u2013 the doddering old ladies with their shocking stories from their pasts, the lonely heiresses who come to take their lives there, the high-fashion models struggling to manage their professional lives, the deli workers and taxi drivers and drug dealers \u2013 all mingling, conversing, and sharing their lives in the lobbies and elevators, in the roof gardens and at El Quijote next door,\" says Tippins. \"Together, they comprise a human tapestry mirrored in paintings, songs, dances, compositions, sculpture, photographs, and stories and novels that have been created there.\"You may wonder how artists of varying success \u2013 who are not always known for timely paychecks \u2013 managed to score rooms at a famous hotel in downtown New York City.Tippins explains that historically, for many, the hotel was purposely made affordable because the Bard family, who managed the hotel from the 1930s through early 2000s, recognized the value of having well-known visitors or residents in the hotel. The Bards were willing to discount rent (or even forego rent or accept artworks in lieu of cash) to help artists make their way.\"During these years, the hotel grew increasingly run-down, which was fine with most residents since that meant the rent could not be raised too drastically, either \u2013 the fortunate trade-off that anyone who's lived in rent-stabilized housing in NYC understands,\" says Tippins.She also points out that it's remarkable how, over its 130-plus history, the Chelsea became a reflection of the state of the larger world. For example, when the Great Depression struck, the hotel was threadbare and lost much of its sheen. Then, in the 1960s and 70s, emergent drug culture and a plethora of social stressors and financial problems took a toll. More recently, she says, greed-fueled real estate transactions filled the pockets of investors while causing untold heartache for residents.But no matter the hardships, the Chelsea will always be a source of legends and lore.\"It's a place of contradictions, where everyone is having a Quixotic adventure and windmills are in fact giants,\" says Nicolaia Rips. \"It's a place of individual instability yet community. It's ephemeral and lofty yet debased. I would say it's the best place I've ever been, and its residents are the best people I've ever met.\"It's where Leonard Cohen and Janis Joplin carried on affair that wove its way into two of Cohen's songs (\"Chelsea Hotel No. 2\" is, in fact, an ode to Joplin). And it's the place that Sid Vicious, of the Sex Pistols, was charged with stabbing his girlfriend Nancy Spungen to death in their room in 1978 (he died from a drug overdose while on bail in 1979).Brighter moments shined here, too. It's where Arthur C. Clarke wrote \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" Allen Ginsburg, Tennessee Williams, Thomas Wolfe, Chick Corea, Tom Waits and Rufus Wainwright all bartered and traded ideas on life and art within these walls. Joni Mitchell's \"Chelsea Morning\" was written about the place.Ray Mock, who co-wrote the book, \"Hotel Chelsea: Living in the Last Bohemian Haven,\" says in an email interview that the hotel will always be known for its outrageous celebrities.\"But to me one of the most important discoveries in working on our book was that it was the great number of not-so-famous artists, artisans, intellectuals and dreamers who really kept the spirit of the place alive, toiling away at their life's work for years or decades within the building's thick walls and forming a tightly knit community,\" he says. \"Some of them are still there and continue, each in their own way, to preserve the Chelsea's legacy.\"It's no wonder, then, why it's so beloved, by so many, and why people from around the world come to simply stand on the sidewalks outside and behold its modest magnificence.\"No matter how run-down it gets, no matter how chaotic its management, no matter who many times the rent is hiked up, artists can't get enough of life lived in community there,\" says Tippins. \"Even now, with the building shut down and half-hidden by scaffolding, and only 50 or so apartments occupied, tourists arrive every day to marvel at the bronze plaques posted alongside its entrance commemorating the lives of artists who lived there, and to dream that someday they might live creatively at the Chelsea, too.\"HowStuffWorks may earn a small commission from affiliate links in this article.The dust has nearly settled on a long-simmering renovation dispute at the Chelsea. For the past decade, several residents fought infrastructure updates, and everyone living there found themselves stuck in an infinite loop of construction that started (and stopped) again and again. That means residents and admirers may finally see the hotel freed from its shackles of scaffolding sometime in the near future. As for the structure's original artistic intentions, it's anyone's guess how those noble ideas will play out."},

If there is an activity that involves the great outdoors, then there's a potential for danger, accident and ultimately a need for rescue.AdvertisementWhen it comes to search and rescue (SAR), the debate over who should foot the bill has reached a fever pitch. Every time a high profile rescue is performed because an outdoor enthusiast acted recklessly or maybe even illegally, the news media is rife with commentary over the cost associated with the operation. In years past, these rescues didn't get as much attention, but as expenses have grown, it's become a hot topic that can't be ignored. It also has something to do with the nature of the \"extreme\" athlete. The mountain face can never be high enough; the ski run can never be steep enough. These thrill-seekers look for ground that no one else dares to tread, and this kind of recreation comes with inherent dangers.The cost of rescue operations varies wildly depending on the scenario. Who ultimately pays depends on what agencies are involved in the rescue, where it takes place and the circumstances that put the victim into harm's way to begin with.

Who knows what's going on there?The island of Guam is about 30 miles (48.2 kilometers) long and maybe only 12 miles (19.3 kilometers) across at its widest point. A tiny island like that, admittedly, is easy to lose sight of way out in the Pacific, some 3,800 miles (6,115 kilometers) west of Honolulu. Who knows what's going on there?Yet something no one should be confused about concerns Guam's allegiances. Due to its designation as a U.S. territory and its position on the other side of the international date line, Guam boasts as its semi-official slogan, \"Where America's Day Begins.\" Thousands of U.S. troops are stationed there. Its roughly 160,000 residents are U.S. citizens. Michael San Nicolas represents the island in Congress.Guam may not be the America that many think of when they consider Old Glory, baseball and unfettered consumerism. But make no mistake: Guam is American. It might be proper to recognize those on Guam, and the other permanently populated U.S. territories in the Pacific and Caribbean, as full-on Americans.Rather than, say, foreigners. Or some breakaway group that the Mother Nation has to step on to control.Rather than, you know, the way England treated its American colonies a couple of centuries ago.\"America has a colonies problem,\" says lawyer Neil Weare, the president and founder of Equally American, a pro-territories rights group. \"A few years ago, I would not have used the word colonies to describe the relationship [between the U.S. and its territories]. But I think over the last year, with the focus on racial justice ... the word colony now, I think people don't bat an eye. It just describes the relationship now more than ever.\"AdvertisementAmerica has a long history with territories. The Northwest Territory, the Southwest Territory, the Oregon Territory, the Indiana Territory, Alabama, Arkansaw, Louisiana ... virtually every state now in the union began its American adventure as at least part of a territory or two, nomenclature aside. Even before the Declaration of Independence, what were the original \"colonies\" if not \"territories\" of England?As the United States gobbled its way across North America in pursuit of its Manifest Destiny, every former territory was either molded into a state or a few of them. In 1959, Alaska and Hawaii both went from territories to stars on the flag.And there things stopped.More than 60 years later, the U.S. still has five permanently populated territories sitting in various states of American-ness, none on a fast track to statehood. A quick look:American Samoa: Acquired in an 1899 treaty with Germany, American Samoa is considered a territory that is both unincorporated (which means that only parts of the U.S. Constitution apply) and unorganized (which means that Congress hasn't enacted a set of laws, like a Bill of Rights, specifically for that territory). It differs from the other territories on this list in one major way: People born in American Samoa are considered U.S. nationals, not U.S. citizens.Generally, all citizens are nationals, but nationals are not citizens. Nationals \"owe allegiance\" to the U.S., and can be granted a U.S. passport, but do not share many advantages of citizens. Strangely, and constitutionally questionable, U.S. citizens in the 50 states and D.C. have more rights than U.S. citizens from some of the territories below ... a major bone of contention for the people on this list.The Northern Mariana Islands: Once part of the U.N. Trust Territory of the Pacific (TTPI), the Northern Marianas (Guam is the southernmost island in the archipelago) are now considered a \"commonwealth in political union with and under the sovereignty\" of the U.S. About 90 percent of the population (about 51,000 total) lives on the island of Saipan. Commonwealths \u2014 the Northern Marianas and Puerto Rico \u2014 are generally considered to have a \"more highly developed relationship\" with the U.S. than other territories. The people of the Marianas are U.S. citizens by birth or descent.Puerto Rico: Spain ceded control of the island of Puerto Rico to the U.S. in 1899. The population far outpaces that of the other territories; it's about 3.1 million, 2.4 million of that is in San Juan. Puerto Rico is considered an unincorporated organized territory of the U.S., with commonwealth status. Citizens of Puerto Rico are U.S. citizens by birth or descent.U.S. Virgin Islands: Purchased for $25 million in 1917 from Denmark, the U.S. Virgin Islands are considered an unincorporated organized territory of the U.S. The population, estimated at 105,000, is about 76 percent Black. Its economy runs on, among other industries, tourism, watch making and rum distilling. Its people are U.S. citizens by birth or descent.Guam: Taken from Spain by the U.S. in 1898 during the Spanish-American War, Guam was captured by the Japanese for three years in World War II. The U.S. liberated the island in 1944. It's been considered an unincorporated organized territory of the U.S. since 1950. The U.S. military bases are critical in the Pacific theater. People born on Guam, and their descendants, are U.S. citizens.AdvertisementThe current state of America's territories could best be described as separate and unequal.Territories pay billions of dollars in federal taxes (though, generally, not through personal income taxes). Some 20,000 people from the territories serve in the U.S. military. American Samoa has more military enlistments, per capita, than any state in the Union.But whether the people who live there are citizens (as they are in every territory but American Samoa) or nationals (as they are in American Samoa), they don't get to vote for U.S. president. They are represented in the U.S. House of Representatives, but with a nonvoting representative. There are no territorial representatives in the U.S. Senate.\"More than 3.5 million Americans are denied the right to vote in presidential elections because they live in one of five U.S. territories.,\" Stacey Plaskett, the U.S. Virgin Islands' delegate to Congress, wrote in The Atlantic. \"That number is equivalent to the population of the five smallest states combined.\"It's more than just being able to vote for president every four years, though.\"We pay billions of dollars in federal taxes, and yet residents of U.S. territories are denied access to crucial federal support. Otherwise eligible citizens in the territories are denied Supplemental Security Income, leaving our most vulnerable seniors and people with disabilities to fend for themselves,\" Plaskett wrote. \"Federal programs, including Medicaid, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the child tax credit, and the Earned Income Tax Credit, are either capped or denied altogether.\"Says Weare: \"It's problematic for who we are as a country.\"Weare's group, Equally American, pushes for equality for the people of the territories; equal representation in Congress, equal citizenship with the rest of America, and the equal rights guaranteed to Americans by the Constitution. The group is supporting several legal challenges to perhaps the biggest obstacle facing territorial rights, a series of six Supreme Court decisions in 1901 that has allowed the U.S. citizens (and nationals) of American territories to be treated differently from other U.S. citizens.Those decisions, known as the Insular Cases, are considered racist by many today. That's especially concerning to the territories, where more than 98 percent of the people are racial or ethnic minorities.Here's an excerpt from one of the 1901 decisions that set up the current fate of the territories, written by then-Supreme Court Justice Henry Billings Brown, who also wrote the majority opinion in the controversial separate-but-equal case Plessy v. Ferguson decision five years earlier:More than 100 years have passed since those decisions, and the territories still sit, neither here nor there. The U.S. provides much to them, but the territories provide the U.S. with much, too.All Weare and others are asking is that the people there be treated like all Americans.\"They're just so marginalized in the American mindset,\" Weare says. \"But we've had these places for a really long time now. And it's time to grapple with that and do something about it. Whether that's statehood, or whether that's independence, or whether that's a constitutional amendment, there are different paths to solving that problem. But until we kind of come to grips with that [colonies problem], it's really hard to find the political will to address and solve these issues.\"The five territories discussed in this piece are considered the major territories. The United States also has what's called the United States Minor Outlying Islands, which are eight island territories with no permanent residents. These include Baker Island, Howland Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Atoll, Palmyra Atoll and Wake Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, and Navassa Island in the Caribbean Sea."},

Now it's all over in a little less than two weeks.\"AdvertisementThe reason for Hitler's spectacular early success in WWII was a brazen new style of warfare known as Blitzkrieg, a combination of the German words for \"lightning\" (blitz) and \"war\" (krieg) coined by Western journalists who were floored by the speed and ferocity of the Nazi attack.\"The Blitzkrieg shocked the world,\" says Kirchubel, \"that an enemy army could be defeated so quickly and that nobody seemingly had a counter for it.\"Nearly 2 million German soldiers were killed during World War I, primarily as casualties of an agonizingly slow style of fighting known as trench warfare. In the first battles of WWI, all sides suffered such devastating losses from artillery, machine guns and other modern weapons that they resorted to digging long trenches in the battlefield for protection. The mud-filled, rat-infested trenches became the closest thing to hell on earth for these soldiers.One of the longest and deadliest examples of trench warfare was the 141-day Battle of the Somme, in which the British, French and German armies suffered more than a million combined casualties.Every nation that fought in WWI vowed to never fight in another miserable trench, but they each had different ideas for how to achieve it, says Kirchubel. During the interwar years, the British invested heavily in aircraft technology, planning to fly over trenches and bomb the enemy at home. The French decided to build a more permanent and fortified version of a trench known as the Maginot Line, a series of 58 underground fortresses constructed along the French-German border in the 1930s.The German military took a different tack.\"The Germans said, 'We're going to blast through the trench with this new technique,'\" Kirchubel says.The philosophy of Blitzkrieg is to hit the enemy hard where it's the weakest and attack with three components of the military at once: armored tanks, infantry and air bombardment.\"With Blitzkrieg, your armor would always be the spearhead \u2014 the tanks would always be at the front.\" says Martin King, an Emmy-winning military historian and author of several excellent books on WWII. \"The infantry would come up behind, normally in half-trucks and trucks. As soon as the armor engaged, the Stukas and the Messerschmitts (German bombers and fighter planes) would come in flying low and basically decimate the opponents.\"Kirchubel says that Blitzkrieg was inspired by old-school Prussian ideas of indirect warfare \u2014 not fighting the opponent \"strength against strength,\" but exploiting weaknesses instead. To compare warfare to a boxing match, Blitzkrieg is the one-two punch that quickly knocks your opponent to the mat, not a drawn-out, 12-round decision.\"Blitzkrieg was fast, it was furious, it was accurate and it did the job,\" says King.A key component of Blitzkrieg was a flexible command-and-control structure within the German army. Early in the war, Hitler had full faith in his generals, especially Erwin Rommel and Heinz Guderian, so the Fuhrer didn't have to personally authorize every attack plan. In turn, those generals delegated authority in battle to lower-ranking field officers so they could quickly react to changing conditions on the ground.German tanks, which were inferior in many ways to the French Renault tanks, came with one important technological upgrade \u2014 a two-way radio. Tank commanders not only received orders, but passed critical battlefield info back up the chain of command."},

A grim and determined pilot, goggles in place, alone in his cockpit, guides his streaking plane through cloudy wartime skies toward the enemy ship and a fiery death.The kamikaze, as we understand him now, seems both heroic and horrifying at the same time. Depending on where your World War II allegiances lie, he may be just one or the other.But the kamikaze is, with no argument anywhere, legendary in the annals of human battle.\"Surely, the Kamikaze war was the strangest and in many ways most dramatic ever waged,\" the late Gordon Allred writes in the 2007 edition of his 1957 book, \"Kamikaze,\" which contains the somewhat disputed account of kamikaze Yasuo Kuwahara. \"One wherein nearly five thousand young men were converted by their leaders into human bombs as the suicide pilots who lived to die and caused the greatest losses in the history of our United States Navy.\"Never have so many human beings unitedly and deliberately agreed to die for their country without hope of any alternative.\"AdvertisementWhen Mongol emperor Kublai Khan sent his naval fleets to attack Japan in the 13th century, fierce winds twice repelled the invasions. The Japanese considered these storms direct gifts from the gods and called them \"kamikaze.\" The most common translation of the word is \"divine wind.\"In October 1944, after stinging defeats had turned the tide of World War II against the Axis powers \u2014 the U.S. retook Guadalcanal in 1943, liberated Guam in July 1944 and started bombing Okinawa in October of that year \u2014 Japan's commanders in the Pacific were desperate. They needed to slow the onslaught of the Allies though, in reality, many knew that it was just a matter of time until the war was over. Japan was looking for some divine intervention.Vice Admiral Takijir\u014d \u014cnishi, commander of Japanese naval air forces in the Philippines, decided to unleash a new tactic on the enemy: suicide bombers.\"In my opinion, there is only one way of assuring that our meager strength will be effective to a maximum degree,\" Ohnishi told his men, according to Capt. Rikihei Inoguchi in \"The Divine Wind: Japan's Kamikaze Force in World War II,\" originally published in 1958. \"That is to organize suicide attack units composed of Zero fighters armed with 250-kilogram bombs, with each plane to crash-dive into an enemy carrier.\" (The Mitsubishi A6M \"Rei-sen\" was the chief aircraft of Japan during World War II. The Japanese pilots called the plane the \"Zero-sen\" based on the Imperial Year calendar (1940). The Allies eventually dubbed the plane the Zero.) And so the modern-day version of kamikaze was launched.AdvertisementStatistics vary, but thousands of kamikaze sorties were launched in the final months of the war, and more than 3,000 Japanese pilots were killed. Those attacks resulted in the sinking of some 47 ships, killing more than 7,000 U.S., Australian and British soldiers.That sounds deadly effective. But it really wasn't.\"The statistic I quote ... says that 27 percent of the attacks in [the battle of] the Philippines resulted in either a hit or a near miss that caused damage to the ship ... In the battle of Okinawa, when most of the kamikaze pilots were going in, I think it was like 13 percent,\" Bill Gordon, who has been collecting data and stories on kamikaze on his site, \"Kamikaze Images,\" since the early 2000s, says from a town near Nagoya, Japan. \"I guess it's what you compare it to. The reason they were making the attacks was that the conventional attacks were not effective. In the Philippines, they originally thought they were doing great. But 13 percent is pretty low. That means 87 percent were shot down, some well before they reached any ship, by American fighters.\"Most people look at it and say they already lost the war by the time the kamikaze attacks started, so regardless of how effective they were, they were going to lose. If the percentages were higher, it really doesn't matter.\"Japanese suicide missions in World War II were not only limited to dive-bombing Zeros. Midget submarines (k\u014dhy\u014dteki in Japanese), manned torpedoes (kaiten), manned rocket-powered gliders (\u014dka) and motorboats carrying depth-charges (shin'y\u014d) all were used at various stages of the war.  AdvertisementStill, when historians look upon kamikazes, it is the dive-bombing suicide planes, part of a Special Attack Corps (Tokubetsu K\u014dgekitai), that remain the focus.In 1975, in Chiran, Kagoshima Prefecture in the southern part of Japan, the Chiran Peace Museum \u2014 otherwise known as the Chiran Peace Museum for Kamikaze Pilots \u2014 opened. Thousands of articles left behind by kamikazes, including letters to loved ones before their final missions, are featured.Here's a typical one from Corp. Takao Adachi, who took off on his final mission on June 1, 1945. He was 17. (As translated by Kamikaze Images' Gordon.)\"The big topics, they're talking about filial piety to their parents, what commitment they had, and saying how sorry they were that they were leaving and dying, basically,\" Gordon says.The letters have helped portray the young men who flew these missions \u2014 their average age was around 21 \u2014 not as crazed suicide bombers but as loyal sons of Japan, heroic and worthy of praise. It's a widely held belief in Japan, though not everyone thinks that way.In comparison, many Americans \u2014 especially older ones \u2014 see kamikazes only as those grim Zero pilots bearing down on poor American soldiers, bent on killing and destruction. Instead of heroism, they see madness.That may have changed some over the generations. \"In the U.S., it's probably not as extreme anymore,\" Gordon says. \"But I will tell you, people were emotional when I talked to them about it on the U.S. side [when he did research back in the early 2000s]. Some people didn't even want to talk to me.\"Kamikazes, in the end, were fighters on the front line of a war that their side was losing badly. Americans already were bombing cities in Japan from bases in China. More raids were coming. The kamikazes were Japan's last resort. And so they went out fighting for their country.\"I still think,\" Gordon says, \"that most of them believed that there was a good chance that they could somehow at least stop the American advances \u2014 if not necessarily win the war \u2014 and not have the destruction of Japan.\"By the end of the war, as many as 3,800 kamikaze pilots died. \"We didn't think too much [about dying],\" Hisao Horiyama, one of the last two surviving kamikaze pilots told The Guardian in 2015 at age 92. \"We were trained to suppress our emotions. Even if we were to die, we knew it was for a worthy cause. Dying was the ultimate fulfillment of our duty, and we were commanded not to return. We knew that if we returned alive that our superiors would be angry.\" "},

And no, it's not because of the sharp needles.AdvertisementThose who study encryption know that for centuries, wartime knitting has conjured shadowy powers in secret knitted codes \u2014 crafted directly into the stitches of garments \u2014 that were passed along to allies who decrypted the strands and then planned their responses accordingly.The practice, which is technically called steganography, has actually been around for thousands of years. It refers to the act of hiding secret messages in ordinary items so as to not arouse suspicion. With enough expertise and calm nerves, a clever person could pass detailed messages right under the noses of even the most intelligent adversary.To understand how codes are crafted into knitting, you need a bit of a handicraft background.\"Knitting is made up of different stitches, the most common of which are the knit and purl; at its simplest, relatable to binary code,\" says Melissa Kemmerer, co-creator of Nomadic Knits knitting and culture magazine. \"Knit stitches are flat and resemble the letter 'V', while purl stitches are horizontal bumps.\"In essence, that means anyone with the right skills and knitting prowess could learn to hide messages in fabric \u2014 and there are infinite ways to do so. You could conceal numbers or text as Morse code, which uses a series of basic dashes and dots to relay information.By alternating these two stitches to produce Morse code, the knitter could send encrypted messages through something like an innocent-looking sweater, Kemmerer says. The message sender could pass along the garment to an undercover agent, who'd interpret the code and send along the message to headquarters. Non-knitters, as many soldiers tended to be, would not likely notice anything unusual about a piece of knitting.\"Knit and purl stitches are regularly used together in patterns to create a variety of common textures (picture the ribbing on the hems and cuffs of a sweater), and the odd purl bump hidden in a pattern of knit stitches could easily be overlooked, or if noticed, assumed to part of the intended patterning,\" says Kemmerer. \"Even when more noticeable stitches were used to encode a message into the garment, it would appear to the uneducated eye to be simply a mistake. Experienced knitters can spot any variation in stitches right away, especially when knowing where to look.\""},

There isn't a consensus on how best to classify them or how many subspecies there are, however. An estimated 200,000 brown bears live primarily in North America and Russia [source: McLellan]. The Mexican grizzly is a subspecies of brown bear, so cursory research would seem to indicate that the Mexican grizzly is not extinct.However, if you do a little more digging, you'll find that the International Union for Conservation of Nature produced a book in 1982 stating that Mexican grizzlies were extinct. The IUCN is the organization that tracks the conservation status of plants and animals and ranks animals as threatened, endangered or apparently safe. The group also classifies Mexican grizzlies as a subspecies of brown bear.AdvertisementThe story goes like this: Once upon a time, in the not-so-distant past, a subspecies of brown bears called Mexican grizzly bears lived in the southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. By all accounts, they were smaller than their counterparts in Canada and the northern United States. In the early 1960s, a Mexican rancher began a campaign to eradicate the bears because he blamed them for slaughtering his cattle (in reality, the bears eat mainly plants and insects and rarely go after small mammals). Due to the cattleman's efforts, the Mexican grizzly was probably extinct by 1964.So is the Mexican grizzly really extinct? It is presumed to be so, although the brown bear species continues to thrive in parts of North America, Europe and Asia. Ecologists consider the Mexican grizzly extirpated, which means it is locally extinct."},

Of the roughly 8.5 million French soldiers mobilized in 1914 to fight Germany and the other Central Powers, more than 6 million became casualties, either killed, wounded or declared missing during four years of grueling trench warfare.In the wake of that catastrophic war, the French government vowed to protect its vulnerable northeast border with Germany from any future attacks. With fresh memories of fighting and living in squalid, open-air trenches, the French spent a decade building a 300-mile (482-kilometer) series of underground fortifications that would be both impenetrable and comfortable to live in. Behind an imposing line of pop-up gun turrets, tank traps and 12-foot (3.6-meter) concrete walls were fully equipped subterranean military bases complete with mess halls, hospitals, recreation facilities and railway lines.These impressive fortifications \u2014 142 large artillery forts called ouvrages or \"works,\" 352 fortified gun emplacements called \"casemates,\" and 5,000 smaller bunkers and pillboxes \u2014 became known as the Maginot Line, named after the French politician Andr\u00e9 Maginot (pronounced Mah-ji-noh). The line wasn't Maginot's idea alone, but he helped push the ambitious, multimillion-franc project through parliament.Despite its monumental concrete glory, which was the pride of interwar France, the Maginot Line ultimately wasn't able to stop Adolf Hitler's Nazi war machine from quickly overwhelming and occupying France in World War II. But does that mean that the Maginot Line was the colossal blunder that many historians have made it out to be?Not according to Robert Kirchubel, a military historian with the FORCES Initiative at Purdue University.\"The Maginot Line was meant to stop a World War I-style attack of infantry and artillery, and it did what it was supposed to do,\" says Kirchubel, who's written multiple books on World War II military campaigns. The problem was that Hitler and his generals abandoned the \"static\" style of WWI fighting for a far more mobile blitzkrieg attack that punched a hole into France through Belgium and the Netherlands. \"That's the part that fell apart for the Allies.\"AdvertisementThe Maginot Line was the brainchild of Marshal Joseph Joffre, a French WWI general, but it was hardly a new idea. The French had been building state-of-the-art fortresses and fortified cities along the German border for centuries.\"That's just what the French did,\" says Kirchubel. \"The Maginot Line fit perfectly with this kind of thinking.\"In the 17th century, from his luxurious palace at Versailles, Louis XIV oversaw the construction of citadels and fortresses meant to mark and protect the Sun King's territory. The genius behind these innovative fortifications was S\u00e9bastien Le Prestre de Vauban, who designed dozens of strongholds, including the magnificent fortified town of Neuf-Brisach in the contested Alsace-Lorraine region bordering Germany.Fortress construction in France continued through the 19th century. After a humiliating defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the French built a ring of 19 heavily fortified military bases around the ancient city of Verdun in northeastern France near the borders with Germany, Luxembourg and Belgium. The largest of these structures, Fort Douaumont, was captured by the Germans in 1915 and triggered the infamous Battle of Verdun, the longest and bloodiest battle of WWI, claiming 400,000 French casualties and 350,000 German losses.\"With the Maginot Line, Joffre's idea was to take these fortifications that France had had for 200 years and bring them into the mid-20th century,\" says Kirchubel.AdvertisementThe Maginot Line took 10 years to build, starting in 1929. By the eve of WWII, the French had constructed a string of fortifications stretching from the Swiss Alps to the English Channel, but the heaviest defenses were along the 280-mile (450-kilometer) border with Germany.The Germany-facing section of the Maginot Line presented a string of obstacles, traps and artillery forts that ran 16 miles (25 kilometers) deep in places. An advancing German army would first be spotted by camouflaged observation points hugging the German border. The enemy's position would be communicated to a cluster of 78 fire control stations that coordinated the French defense from hilltop outposts.The fire control stations would give orders to the hundreds of anti-tank and heavy artillery positions that could pop out of the ground and fire from armored turrets. Behind them were minefields and tank traps made from row after row of porcupine-like iron girders that would cripple armored vehicles. French engineers even constructed emergency dams and levees that could flood the surrounding fields to further slow the German attack.The last line of defense was the Maginot Line's massive ouvrages, each large enough to hold 500 to 1,000 permanent troops. These colossal concrete \"works\" packed heavy firepower and were connected to nearby stations by underground rail lines to shuttle men, weapons and supplies. While the accommodations weren't luxurious, the barracks and mess halls were a tremendous improvement over the mud, freezing cold and disease of WWI trenches.AdvertisementWhen Joffre, Maginot and others conceived of the Maginot Line, Germany was under tight military restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles.\"The Maginot Line would have done just fine against a German army with no tanks, airplanes or heavy artillery,\" says Kirchubel, all of which were banned inside Germany after WWI.But when Hitler and the Nazis rose to power in the early 1930s, they quickly backed out of the Treaty of Versailles and began equipping for a much different kind of war. While the Germans built a fleet of bombers and armored vehicles for their mobile blitzkrieg strategy, the French were putting the finishing touches on their very large and static underground fortresses.\"Maginot Line\" has acquired a secondary meaning: a defensive barrier or strategy that inspires a false sense of security, according to Merriam-Webster. But this may not be a fair characterization.Keep in mind, says Kirchubel, that the French didn't believe that the Maginot Line alone could win another war with Germany. The heavy fortifications were designed to block the most direct line of attack into France and avoid repeating what happened in WWI, when the German forces occupied large swaths of the strategically important Alsace-Lorraine region.\"Maginot and these other guys weren't dumb,\" says Kirchubel. \"The Maginot Line was never meant to fight the war by itself. It was part of a bigger plan to force a German attack through Belgium. When the bigger plan went to crap, the Maginot Line went along with it.\"AdvertisementBy the time Germany invaded Poland in 1939, it was clear to French military leaders that they had greatly underestimated the speed and ruthless efficiency of the German blitzkrieg. But it was too late to reorganize the entire French military in a matter of months. The French strategy was already set in millions of cubic feet of concrete.The Nazis knew that the heart of the Maginot Line was nearly impenetrable, so they feinted attacks along the heavily fortified border while they planned for their massive 1940 invasion of France through the Netherlands and Belgium. The boldest and most pivotal German line of attack ran through the dense Ardennes Forest in Belgium, which both the French and the other Allies had dismissed as impassable.The thick-walled forts and casemates of the Maginot Line withstood direct hits from German bombers as they were designed to do, but the real action happened far away from that solid line of defense. By the time the Germans crossed into French soil through Belgium, the fight was all but over.\"The French were beaten emotionally and spiritually,\" says Kirchubel. \"They cashed in their chips. They fought for four years in WWI, but were done in a week in WWII.\" Just six weeks after Hitler began his land invasion of the country, France surrendered to Germany.While most of the giant underground fortresses of the Maginot Line were abandoned or destroyed, you can visit a few of them, still in working order. Check out the Hackenberg Maginot Fort, now a military museum offering tours, and the Schoenenbourg Fort."},

When the plant sensed her presence, it captured her with its tentacles and pulled her into its body.One hundred years later, a 1950s science writer debunked the legend, asserting that not only was there no such tree, but that no one by name of Carl Liche had ever explored Madagascar.AdvertisementWhile a tentacle-wielding, man-consuming tree may not exist, a scaled-down version of such a plant does. The man-eating tree of Madagascar may have been an exaggeration of the pitcher plants that grow in Madagascar, Indonesia, Australia, Malaysia and other hot and humid, low-lying areas. The largest of the pitcher plants is known as Nepenthes, and this plant does capture small vermin and lizards in its pitchers (or cupped leaves).The pitcher plant creates a substance that coats the inside of its pitchers. This substance mixes with water that the plant draws up through its roots. Insects and, on occasion, small animals are attracted to the scented water. When they come to drink, they fall into the pitcher, are unable to escape, and the plant draws nutrients from the captured prey.While you certainly won't fall prey to the pitchers of the Nepenthes -- they're entirely too small to hold a human -- you could easily fall prey to the sickness some plants induce.

One year later, the priestly council of Memphis \u2014 an ancient Egyptian river city \u2014 commemorated the occasion (and affirmed his royal cult) by issuing a routine decree.Their words were carved onto a granodiorite rock slab in three different scripts. Toward the bottom, the message appears in ancient Greek. Halfway up, we see it expressed in Demotic, a popular handwriting system the Egyptians had used for over a thousand years, from the seventh century B.C.E. until the fifth century C.E.Then, up at the very top, the council's decree was written out again in an intricate, endlessly fascinating collection of symbols: Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.French engineers rediscovered a large chunk of this slab in 1799 C.E. (alas, the rest has been lost to the ages). Since it turned up in Rashid, Egypt, formerly called \"Rosetta,\" the artifact became known as the \"Rosetta Stone.\"Perennially, it's the most popular exhibit at the British Museum in London, England. And for good reason: The Rosetta Stone helped scholars decipher Egypt's long-mysterious hieroglyphic system.AdvertisementJanet Johnson is a professor of Egyptology at the University of Chicago and the director of the Chicago Demotic Dictionary Project. \"The hieroglyphic writing system was developed in the early dynasties of Egyptian history, before 3000 B.C.E.,\" she tells us in an email. It stuck around for quite a while; the last known hieroglyphic inscriptions were made at the Temple of Isis at Philae in about 394 CE.Sometimes, the script was chiseled into rock (as in the Rosetta Stone's case). It could also be painted onto temple walls or on ancient metals and ceramics.Any writing system that lasts for thousands of years is bound to inspire derivatives. And this one was no exception.Hieroglyphs look terrific on monuments, but they were ill-suited for everyday use. Enter Hieratic, a simplified cursive script based on Egyptian hieroglyphics. First introduced in the Old Kingdom (which lasted from 2700 to 2200 B.C.E.), it went through a few different iterations over the millennia.According to Johnson, Hieratic was committed to papyrus and ostraca; the latter were basically notepads made of pottery shards and limestone fragments. Hieratic wasn't the only alternative to hieroglyphics. Says Johnson, it was later \"supplemented by ... [Demotic] in the middle of the first millennium, B.C.E.\"Meanwhile, she notes that \"hieroglyphics continued to be used for their decorative, as well as communicative value, on limestone monuments\" such as temples and tombs.AdvertisementAbout 25 symbols in the Egyptian hieroglyphic \"alphabet\" denote specific sounds. \"But very few words were written purely alphabetically,\" cautions Johnson.Context is king; some signs were used to express ideas rather than sounds. On one tomb that was made sometime between about 2181 and 1640 B.C.E., a jackal is pictured sitting atop a shrine \u2014 just to the right of three other symbols.This jackal sign acted as a \"determinative.\" Its purpose was to tell the reader that the preceding symbols collectively mean \"Anubis,\" the name of an Egyptian god. Plus, a few of the hieroglyphic signs are \"biliteral\" or \"triliteral.\" As Johnson tells us, these indicate \"two or three sounds in a specific order.\" (E.g., \"R+N\" versus \"N+R.\")Altogether, hundreds of Egyptian hieroglyphic symbols are known.AdvertisementWith the possible exception of King Tutankhamun, none of ancient Egypt's rulers or co-rulers are as well-known today as Cleopatra VIII. A famous alliance with Mark Anthony of Rome put her on the losing side of a Roman Civil War \u2014 and in consequence, Cleopatra took her own life in 30 B.C.E.Once the dust settled, her homeland became a province of the Roman Empire.\"The hieroglyphic writing system and its derivatives ... were replaced by Greek as an administrative language during the Roman occupation,\" says Johnson.Then, as Christianity took hold across Egypt, the hieroglyphic system fell into disuse. So did the Hieratic and Demotic scripts it inspired.\"The spoken language continued in the Egyptian Christian church (where it is called Coptic),\" Johnson explains. \"Coptic is still used as a liturgical language in the church, but it is written in the Greek alphabet, supplemented by some signs from Demotic for sounds in the Egyptian language which were not found in the Greek language.\"But what became of the neglected hieroglyphics? Well, for centuries, their decipherment was a forgotten art.Historians who longed to make sense of them finally caught a big break when the Rosetta Stone popped up. Decoding the 44 by 30-inch (112 by 76-centimeter) slab was an project that took scholars Thomas Young and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Champollion two decades to complete. And Egyptology would never be the same.Memphis, Tennessee, was named after the ancient city of Memphis, Egypt. That's because both settlements bordered a great river; Elvis Presley's longtime home sits on the Mississippi while ancient Memphis overlooked the Nile."},

Under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the CIA recruited Cuban exiles in the U.S. to form a counter-revolutionary army at a covert CIA training camp in Nicaragua called \"Happy Valley.\" The group was known as Brigade 2506. When John F. Kennedy was elected president in 1960, he inherited a convoluted scheme to invade Cuba using 1,500 of these anti-Castro Cubans trained by the CIA.The mission, known as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, was doomed from the start and is widely regarded as one of America's worst foreign policy failures. The attack began the morning of April 15, 1961, with what was supposed to be an aerial bombardment of Castro's small air force. But the CIA-trained pilots, who flew World War II-era B-26 bombers painted to look like Cuban planes, failed to destroy all of Castro's aircraft.AdvertisementThat's when things really started to unravel, says Jim Rasenberger, author of \"The Brilliant Disaster: JFK, Castro, and America's Doomed Invasion of Cuba's Bay of Pigs\". Here are five reasons why the Bay of Pigs Invasion went so spectacularly wrong.While eight of the B-26 bombers were sent to destroy Castro's airfields, a ninth flew directly to Miami, Florida, where \"the CIA came up with this cockamamie idea,\" says Rasenberger.The B-26 pilot in Miami claimed to be a defector from Castro's air force who had risen up with his comrades to attack the communist regime. The CIA took pains to make his plane look legit, complete with a Cuban air force serial number and a nose cone riddled with fresh bullet holes, but savvy journalists on the ground quickly saw through the ruse.\"There was still tape on the gun barrels to keep the dust out and his guns were mounted in the nose of the plane, while Castro's were under the wings,\" says Rasenberger. \"It gave away the whole game right there.\"Suddenly, with one bad fake job, it was plain to everyone that the U.S. was clearly behind this invasion. The Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev was furious and Kennedy was backed into a corner. If he admitted U.S. involvement, he risked starting World War III.With the world watching, Kennedy made a difficult decision to cancel a second round of airstrikes planned for the early hours of April 17. Those airstrikes were supposed to destroy the rest of Castro's air force and clear a path for the amphibious pre-dawn landing of 1,500 men.\"The moment Kennedy canceled those airstrikes, he doomed the invasion,\" says Rasenberger. \"Castro still had half of his planes left. For the invasion to have any chance of succeeding, those planes had to be taken out.\"Rasenberger doesn't think Kennedy got \"cold feet,\" as some critics alleged, but rather made a rational decision that a second airstrike wasn't worth going to war with Russia. Unfortunately, it would prove to be the mission's undoing, leaving the invading force and supply ships vulnerable to devastating airstrikes from Castro's remaining pilots."},

It was originally constructed in 1967, and a nearby UFO Tourist Information Centre was opened to accompany the site in 1990, ready to welcome Earthly and extraterrestrial visitors alike.When it comes to movies and television, British Columbia is a star. Thanks to the big tax breaks offered, B.C. has been used in many TV shows and movies, including \"Titanic,\" \"The X-Files,\" \"House\" and \"Big Sky\" and often gets transformed to match what audiences expect. Parts of British Columbia were even made over to represent Santa Barbara, California, for the show \"Psych.\" (Given B.C.'s temperate climate, it wasn't quite sunny enough to pull it off!)The world's first transatlantic flight took off from the capital of Newfoundland, St. John's, in 1919. The pilots, John Alcock and Arthur Brown, touched down in western Ireland. The flight took almost 16 hours.It's no joke that Canadians love to skate \u2013 whether that's for recreation or a good game of hockey. So, it's no surprise that Canada is also home to the world's largest skating rink. The Rideau Canal Skateway in Ottawa, Ontario, is the equivalent of 90 Olympic size skating rinks, and holds the Guinness World Record for its size.AdvertisementSpeaking of hockey, another Canadian province holds the record as home to the world's largest hockey stick and puck. Located outside the Cowichan Community Centre on Vancouver Island, the 205-foot (62-meter) hockey stick is made of Douglas Fir beams and steel and was originally constructed in 1985 for the Expo '86 World's Fair Exposition in VancouverAfter a trio of thieves tried to make off with nearly 3,000 tons of maple syrup (that's 6 million pounds!) worth CA$18.7 million ($15 million) in Saint-Louis-de-Blandford, Quebec, between 2011 and 2012, the Canadian government came down hard. The crooks were all handed down jail sentences and fined nearly CA$10 million ($8 million). The fine was later lowered to CA$1 million.The small New Brunswick town of Florenceville-Bristol is also known as the \"French Fry Capital of the World.\" One-third of the world's frozen french fries are made here by New Brunswick-based McCain Foods. You can also visit the Potato World Museum here, which helps underscore the importance of the spud to this town.Here's more spud news: One of Canada's most famous foods, poutine officially comes from the province of Quebec. This indulgent dish of fries and cheese curds, topped with gravy, hailed from a rural part of the province in the 1950s, though the actual inventor will probably always be up for debate.Life's a giant party in Newfoundland. The province has been shown to have the highest number of bars per capita in Canada, with 3.87 bars per 10,000 people. This is buoyed by George Street in St. John's, which has long been reputed to have the largest number of bars and pubs per square foot in the country \u2013 but nobody has actually measured this to verify if it's true.AdvertisementIf these facts have you in the mood to raise a glass, here's a bucket list drink \u2013 or maybe the last one before you kick the bucket. At the Sourdough Saloon in Dawson City, Yukon Territory, you can order the sourtoe cocktail \u2014 basically any drink, featuring the addition of a preserved human toe. The drink's origin story dates back to a blizzard in the 1920s and a frostbitten toe preserved in a jar that served as the perfect accompaniment to whiskey. The original toe only last seven years (someone swallowed it!), but over the years several more toes have been donated to keep this wild tradition going. As the saloon says of the cocktail, \"You can drink it fast, you can drink it slow \u2014 but the lips have gotta touch the toe.\"Located in far northern Nunavut (on Devon Island in the Canadian Arctic), the Haughton Crater \u2013\u00a0caused by an impact some 39 million years ago \u2013 is considered by scientists to be one of the most Mars-like climates on Earth. As a result, the Haughton-Mars Project was established in 1997 to train astronauts for future Mars missions.While the province is called Prince Edward Island \u2013 singular \u2013\u00a0it actually includes some 232 islands in total, including the main one. With all that coastline, it's no surprise that P.E.I. also has a large number of lighthouses \u2013\u00a0over 63 in total, 35 of which are still active. Nine are open to the public, according to a 2016 report.Speaking of being the capital of something, Canada's sprawling Northwest Territories is known as the Diamond Capital of North America. This is due to the diamond mines located across the territory. The Northwest Territories also are home to mines for gold, silver, lead, tungsten, as well as rare-earth metals and uranium.Back in 1945, Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gifted the Ontario city of Ottawa 100,000 tulip bulbs; now, the city has had an epic tulip festival each spring. Those bulbs are quite prolific, as some 300,000 tulips bloom every year in Commissioners Park. More than 1 million tulips decorate Ottawa.AdvertisementIf you have no fear of snakes, consider making the trek to Manitoba. The Narcisse Snake Dens there are home to the largest concentration of snakes in the world. Every spring, some 75,000 snakes come out of the ground from hibernation.The popular children's book \"Anne of Green Gables\" was written by P.E.I. local Lucy Maud Montgomery in 1908. The book is set near Cavendish Beach on Prince Edward Island's north central coast, and the house that inspired the book is now a protected National Historic Site.The official languages of Canada are French and English, but not every territory and province has this codified into their territorial or provincial constitution. The only one which has codified bilingual rules into its constitution is New Brunswick.While Canada has two official languages, you'll find local expressions across its provinces and territories. But Newfoundland has its own special vocabulary, created over the centuries through a combination of cultural integration and isolation. There you'll hear words like \"dwy\" (a short, sudden storm) and \"lolly\" (the soft ice close to shore that most boats can navigate).The Royal Canadian Mounted Police \u2013\u00a0also called the Mounties \u2013\u00a0academy is located in Regina, Saskatchewan. Since 1885, RCMP cadets have been trained here, and you can visit the RCMP Heritage Centre in Regina to learn more about the history of Canada's famous, iconic police force.More than half of all the world's lakes are located in Canada; there are some 3 million lakes across the country, and 31,700 of them are larger than 741 acres (300 hectares or roughly 400 soccer fields) in size."},

Which is why researchers at Carnegie Mellon University developed an automated method to up the politeness quotient for various communications. The method, aimed at applications such as chatbots, emails and blogs, involves what is known as politeness transfer. Here's how it might be put to use.A company working to create a chatbot \u2013 a computer program that simulates human conversation and interactions with customers \u2013 may use this approach to train its chatbot to respond more politely. So, if the chatbot makes requests or gives instructions that are impolite, or carry a neutral tone, this new method will rearrange and/or add words to the chatbot's responses to improve the tone.AdvertisementFor example, if a chatbot gives the response, \"I need more information,\" the program might teach it to instead say, \"Would you please give me more information?\"When it comes to emails and blogs, a businessperson or blogger may use this automated program to check the tone of the email or blog entry before sending or posting.Language technologists have been training artificial intelligence for years to change negative communications to positive ones. But training for politeness was a distant goal, in part because it's not as easy as it may seem.\"It's not just about using words such as 'please' and 'thank you,'\" Shrimai Prabhumoye, one of the program's creators said in a statement. \"Sometimes, it means making language a bit less direct, so that instead of saying 'you should do X,' the sentence becomes something like 'let us do X.'\"There was also the problem of defining politeness, which differs across cultures. In this inaugural version of the program, researchers used North American standards of politeness.Ironically, to create a politeness response database for their method to use, the researchers culled 1.4 million polite sentences from emails exchanged by employees of Enron \u2013 the Texas energy company that went bust due to fraud and corruption. Thanks to lawsuits that came out of the Enron scandal, some half-a-million corporate emails became public, and now are being used for various research projects such as this one.Thirty-eight percent of Americans say chatbots are politer than humans, according to a recent study. Interestingly, this belief is held by the youngest and oldest survey respondents: 43 percent of those ages 18-24 and 45 percent of those over 65 hold this belief."},

It's a post that's become increasingly important as a source of policy advice and legislative lobbying muscle in presidential administrations, but does it come with an official residence as well?The answer is yes. Since the mid-1970s, the vice president has had a mansion of his (now her) own as well, and though it's not as well known as the White House, it's pretty fancy and historic in its own right.AdvertisementThe vice president's residence, located on the grounds of the United States Naval Observatory about 2.5 miles (4.02 kilometers) northwest of the White House, doesn't have a similarly iconic name. Instead, it's often referred to prosaically as the VPR, or by using its address, Number One Observatory Circle.\"It's probably due to the fact that a catchy name simply didn't develop,\" explains Kyle Kopko, an adjunct professor of political science at Elizabethtown College in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, and the author of two books on vice presidential candidates. \"The White House wasn't originally called that. It developed over time. Originally the White House was called the executive mansion, or president's mansion, or various generic combinations throughout history.\" According to the White House Historical Association, the presidential mansion wasn't officially named the White House until 1901.But don't let that nondescript nomenclature fool you. No. 1 Observatory Circle, built in 1893, is an ornate three-story Queen Anne-style brick Victorian home with 9,150 square feet (850 square meters) of interior space, according to Gail S. Cleere's 1989 book, \"The House on Observatory Hill: Home of the Vice President of the United States.\"\"The demands of the vice presidency and the need for security necessitate a government-owned house for the vice president and the second family,\" Kopko says. \"The establishment of an official vice presidential residence also coincides with the rise of the office's informal power. Historically, the office of the vice president was not very powerful, and the vice president mainly assumed ceremonial duties. However, that changed over time. Vice presidents now play significant advisory roles, oversee policy, and assume a variety of responsibilities on behalf of the president.\"AdvertisementDesigned by Washington architect Leon E. Dessez and built by a Philadelphia-based construction firm, the house originally was intended to serve as the home of the superintendent of the Naval Observatory, and to be a \"gracious country house after the style of the time,\" as Cleere wrote.The ground floor consists of a reception hall, living room, sitting room, sun porch and dining room and pantry, plus offices that were added on the home's north side, according to Cleere's book. The second floor contains two bedrooms, a study, and a den, while the third floor has four more rooms, which originally served as servants' quarters and storage areas. In the basement, there's a kitchen, laundry room and more storage.A dozen observatory superintendents lived in the house from 1893 to 1927. But the mansion was coveted by various officers who held the post of Chief of Naval Operations, and in 1928, Congress finally passed a law giving it to the CNO at the time, Admiral Charles Frederick Hughes (known as \"Handlebars\" because of his lush moustache). He moved into the house the following year, according to Cleere's account.Vice presidents, though, had to find their own places to live. Most either resided in their own homes, or as Calvin Coolidge did during the Warren G. Harding administration, lived in hotels. Coolidge, who became president after Harding's death in 1923, may have been the first to advocate the notion of giving the vice president an official home, in keeping with the dignity of the position. \"The great office should have a settled and permanent habitation and a place, irrespective of the financial ability of its temporary occupant,\" Coolidge wrote in his memoirs.By the mid-1960s, though, the expense of outfitting vice presidential residences with adequate security and communications equipment prompted Congress to pass a bill authorizing construction of a new home for the vice president on a portion of the Naval Observatory grounds, at a cost of $750,000 (about $6 million in today's dollars). But as the cost of the Vietnam war escalated, then-vice president Hubert Humphrey asked that the project be delayed as \"an example of prudent budget practices,\" and the new house was never built, according to this 2017 Indianapolis Star article.Meanwhile, the government continued to spend a fortune outfitting vice presidential residences. After President Richard Nixon picked Gerald R. Ford to replace Spiro Agnew as vice president when Agnew resigned in 1973, construction workers descended upon Ford's home in Alexandria, Virginia, to make extensive modifications, including installation of bullet-resistant windows. Those retrofits were only needed for nine months, because Ford eventually replaced Nixon as president.Eventually, as Cleere's book notes, Congress decided that what was, at the time, called the Admiral House presented another, cheaper alternative. In 1974, Congress passed legislation that took Number One Observatory Circle away from the CNO and made it the vice presidential residence. (The CNO was relocated to Tingey House, an 1804 Georgian-style mansion that stands in the Washington Navy Yard.)But the transition didn't occur right away. Vice President Nelson Rockefeller never actually moved into Number One Observatory Circle, though he used it for official events. Walter Mondale, who moved into the mansion in 1977, was its first vice presidential occupant.Over the years, various modifications have been made to the vice presidential residence. Dan Quayle, who served as vice president during the George H.W. Bush administration, added a swimming pool, according to The Hill. Karen Pence, the wife of Donald J. Trump's vice president Mike Pence, added a beehive as a reminder of bees' important role in agriculture, CNN reported in 2017.After Kamala Harris was sworn in as vice president of the United States in January 2021, she and her husband Doug Emhoff didn't immediately move in. Instead, they temporarily took up residence in Blair House, the presidential guest residence at 1651 Pennsylvania Avenue near the White House, so that repairs and maintenance could be completed.HowStuffWorks may earn a small commission from affiliate links in this article.

", "This map shows the original locations of the \"Five Civilized Tribes\" who were removed to Oklahoma between 1830 and 1834. "], "date": "Mar 8, 2021", "content": "There are currently 574 federally recognized Indian nations (also known as tribes, bands, communities and by other terms) in the U.S. according to the National Congress of American Indians. About 229 are located in Alaska and the rest are in 35 other states. Of that number, five were called the \"Five Civilized Tribes,\" a term which didn't save them from being forcibly removed to \"Indian Territory,\" in the 19th century. So, where did that term come from and who were they?By the time the first European settlers arrived in America, there were already more than two dozen Native American tribes living in and farming the fertile soil of the Southeast, in the area today encompassing the states of North Carolina down through Georgia, Florida and the Gulf Coast. Like other Native peoples who came in contact with Europeans, these Southeastern tribes were ravaged by diseases like smallpox. Over time, they learned to adapt to the encroaching white culture in ways that they believed would secure their survival and sovereignty.Many members of these Southeastern tribes converted to Christianity, for example. They took to wearing European-style clothing and living in frame houses. They adopted the agricultural practices of their Southern white neighbors, including ownership of enslaved people, and sold goods in a market economy. They intermarried with whites, spoke English, and sent their kids to schools run by Christian missionaries.As a result, by 1800, five of the largest Southeastern tribes were routinely referred to by U.S. government officials as \"civilized,\" explains Andrew Frank, a scholar of Indigenous and Seminole history at Florida State University.\"American officials drew a distinction between these five tribes \u2014 the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and somewhat the Seminole \u2014 and what they would call the 'wild, wandering and uncivilized' tribes elsewhere,\" says Frank.The Cherokee were the largest of the \"civilized\" tribes. By 1830, they had a written constitution with a democratically elected assembly and chief, and they published a newspaper in both Cherokee and English.\"Among Southern whites, those earmarks of 'civilization' suggested that there was a willing assimilation into American culture,\" says Mark Hirsch, an historian with the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian.But Frank says that appearances can be deceiving. If you look back deeper into Native American history, Native peoples always incorporated new technologies and customs from their neighbors. And when circumstances in their environment changed \u2014 a drop in wild deer population or the introduction of maize \u2014 the people changed with them.\"But in almost every instance, the adoption of these new outside things was done for the purpose of protecting Indigenous people, not abandoning them,\" says Frank. \"Despite the appearance of 'civilized' customs, Native people had no interest in becoming part of the United States. They had no interest in assimilating into a white norm. How better to resist the oppressors than to learn their language?\"AdvertisementThe irony, of course, is that the much-heralded \"civilization\" of the five largest Southeastern tribes ultimately didn't protect them from being driven off of their tribal lands. In 1830, President Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act into law, authorizing the forced relocation of Southeastern tribes out West to Indian Territory (modern-day Oklahoma), an act that gave rise to the Trail of Tears.Instead of fighting Jackson's order with guns, bows and arrows, tribes like the Cherokee wrote newspaper editorials accusing the U.S. of failing in its Christian obligation to be good neighbors. When the federal government negotiated the fraudulent Treaty of New Echota that relinquished tribal control of their lands, the Cherokee took a \"quintessentially civilized response,\" says Frank. \"They filed a lawsuit and wrote a petition to the U.S. government.\"The \"1836 Protest Petition,\" written by Principal Chief John Ross, pleaded the Cherokee case in language that could have been torn from the Declaration of Independence.The petition fell on deaf ears, as did an earlier Supreme Court ruling that barred government interference in the sovereign tribal lands. Jackson and his supporters would stop at nothing to get their hands on Indian lands, \"civilized\" or not.\"That's the indignity of it all,\" says Frank. \"The United States says, 'If you do X, Y and Z, then you can stay.' So they do X,Y, and Z and also A, B, and C, and lo and behold the desire for Indigenous land overwhelms it all. In the end, it's all about race, not about culture.\"AdvertisementBefore removal, the five largest Southeastern tribes \u2014 the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole \u2014 may have individually employed the word \"civilized\" to differentiate themselves and lobby for preferential treatment, but it wasn't until their arrival in Indian Territory that they became known collectively as the \"Five Civilized Tribes.\"\"We see this throughout history,\" says Frank. \"Often terms that are born of derision or cultural misunderstanding get embraced by the people themselves as tools of resistance. How better for the Five Civilized Tribes in Indian Territory to distinguish themselves as being deserving of recognition than to embrace this term?\"The Five Civilized Tribes joined forces under this new label as a unified negotiating block with the U.S. government. They were still independent tribes, but they shared an identity that they hoped would protect them in the harsh new reality of Indian Territory. Did it work?\"Indigenous people didn't fare well in the 19th century in the United States; that's just a baseline fact,\" says Frank. \"That being said, some Indigenous people fared worse, and some Indigenous people were treated even more harshly by the U.S. than others. In the end, though, the Five Civilized Tribes were put on reservations and subjected to all sorts of indignities.\"Hirsch at the National Museum of the American Indian says that the term Five Civilized Tribes became \"shorthand\" for describing the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek and Seminole well into the 20th century. But as an 1894 census of the Five Civilized Tribes makes clear, the \"civilized\" status of these tribes didn't win them much respect in the eyes of white America.\"The term 'civilized' was originally applied to them in contradistinction to the life of the wild Indian tribes, but as a whole their condition is not the civilization of the Anglo-Saxon,\" reads the census report. \"The civilization of The Five Tribes has not been accomplished without a vast expenditure of time and money by white people. No Indians in the United States have received such care from the whites or have been aided so much by the United States.\"Founded in 1949, the Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Civilized Tribes is one of the oldest and largest tribal organizations in America representing more than 750,000 members of the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Muscogee and Seminole nations to protect tribal self-determination and sovereign rights."},

This implies that North American dinosaur species that lived during the Campanian Age of the Late Cretaceous Period may have been highly localized, the study says.AdvertisementTwo things set Judith and others like it apart from other horned dinosaurs, like the well-known triceratops. First, it has a unique projection of bony spikes around the rim of its shield, some oriented forwards and some outwards. Second, the horncones above the dinosaur's eyes stuck out sideways from its skull, rather than the more common forward- or upward-oriented horns.Judith's scientific name Spiclypeus shipporum combines two Latin words for a genus name meaning spiked shield, while the species name comes from the Shipp family, on whose property the fossil was found.Paleontologists also recently discovered fossils of a dinosaur species identified as\u00a0a dinosaur species identified as\u00a0, a ceratopsid with two large spikes growing from the back of its shield."},

Two popes and two queens came from the Medici line. Art lovers can thank the Medici for fostering and funding great Renaissance talents like Donatello, Botticelli and Michelangelo. And in Florence, which had a love/hate relationship with the Medici, you can hardly walk a block without running into a palace, church or museum that bears the Medici crest or drips with the family's rich cultural inheritance.But how exactly did the Medici get so filthy rich, and did they always use their outsized influence for good? We spoke with Kenneth Bartlett, a Renaissance historian at the University of Toronto and author of \"Florence in the Age of the Medici and Savonarola, 1464-1498: A Short History with Documents,\" to understand the family's indelible stamp on the Renaissance world.AdvertisementThe family originally came from a village in Tuscany but eventually migrated to Florence, its capital. \"They were bankers,\" says Bartlett. \"Beginning with Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici (1360\u20131429), he established several branches of the Medici Bank, the most lucrative associated with the papal court. He made an enormous amount of money doing this, as did many Florentine bankers.\" (It's unclear where their surname came from but \"medici\" is the plural of \"medico\" or \"doctor\" in Italian. So, you should refer to the family members plural as \"the Medici\" rather than \"the Medicis,\" according to Bartlett and others.) Banks in the 14th century were not unlike banks today. The Medici Bank extended loans, held deposits and functioned like a Middle Ages ATM, issuing the most trusted and stable coinage of the era, the florin. Under Giovanni's son, the Medici Bank opened branches in Rome, Venice, Naples, Milan, Geneva, and as far away as London.That son was Cosimo the Elder (not to be confused with at least three other Cosimos in the Medici family tree), who grew incalculably wealthy from the family business while somehow remaining a \"man of the people\" and an artistic tastemaker.At the time, Florence was a young republic, but its politics were still under the thumb of a handful of old-money oligarchs. Cosimo, a fierce defender of republican rule, stood up to the fat cats and was briefly exiled from Florence on trumped up charges. But after a popular rebellion, the oligarchs were ousted, and Cosimo was welcomed back as a hero and \"the first citizen of the republic,\" says Bartlett.Cosimo used his fame, money and political influence to the immense benefit of 15th-century Florence. In politics, he helped break down factionalism by ensuring that people of all political stripes were given the chance to be representatives. But by far his greatest contribution was to the art, architecture and culture of Florence, which became an early jewel of the Italian Renaissance.\"Cosimo saw art and patronage as an instrument of policy,\" says Bartlett. \"He really believed in beautifying the city, but also bringing it dignity and that Italian thing called reputazione \u2014 \"fame\" or \"reputation.\" Towns like to be talked about in positive ways and this gave people an opportunity to do just that.\"One of Cosimo's largest architectural commissions in Florence was the Palazzo Medici, a palatial home designed by Michelozzo which functioned as the Medici family residence and headquarters for its banking empire. If the stately palace wasn't impressive enough, Cosimo filled it with groundbreaking works of art. He commissioned Donatello's David, the first free-standing male nude since antiquity and a masterwork of the early Renaissance, for the palace courtyard.Cosimo's hand is visible throughout modern-day Florence. He completely rebuilt the Church of San Marco and commissioned its frescoes by Fra Angelico. He restarted the ambitious renovation of the Church of San Lorenzo, which features stunning bronze work by Donatello and a library later designed by Michelangelo. A committed Renaissance man, Cosimo acquired one of the largest libraries of classical texts anywhere, and later founded the Platonic Academy, a center of humanist thought.\"Cosimo did so much, partly because of his wealth and also because he wanted to be seen as not a first citizen wielding power, but as a first citizen benefiting the community,\" says Bartlett.When Cosimo the Elder died in 1464, he was awarded the title of Pater Patriae, the \"father of his people,\" and buried in the Church of San Lorenzo right in front of the altar.AdvertisementNot every Medici was memorable. Cosimo the Elder's heir, Piero \"the Gouty,\" was so crippled with the rich man's disease \u2014 gout in the ancient world was caused by a diet composed exclusively of fatty meat and booze \u2014 that he barely left the palace. But the next Medici would outshine them all.\"Lorenzo 'the Magnificent' was 20 years old when he took over the Medici party machine,\" says Bartlett. \"Lorenzo was a great hero, a superb human being, cultivated, extremely intelligent, having both a natural wit and close association with both the common people and patrician class. He was a great patron of art and ideas, and came to define those glory years between 1469 and his death in 1492.\"Botticelli was Lorenzo's favorite painter. Angelo Poliziano was his poet. When Lorenzo spotted the talent of a teenage Michelangelo, he enrolled him in a sculpture school (that Lorenzo also founded) and invited Michelangelo to live at the Palazzo Medici as an honorary member of the family.Life wasn't all art and parties for Lorenzo, though. He was gravely wounded during the Pazzi conspiracy, when a rival banking family tried to stage a violent coup in Florence with the backing of the pope. Lorenzo's brother, Giuliano, was killed in the brazen attack as the two men were at church on Easter Sunday. The attack left Lorenzo paranoid and led to a political reputation as a tyrant.But the real trouble came with the rise of a populist friar named Girolamo Savonarola who railed against the \"pagan\" neoplatonism espoused by Lorenzo and his ilk. Savonarola's preaching became increasingly apocalyptic, insisting that Florence needed to be \"cleansed\" to usher in the Second Coming. Savonarola excoriated the Medici from the pulpit of San Lorenzo and ultimately ran the family out of Florence after Lorenzo died.In a twist, the Florentines embraced Michelangelo's incomparable statue of David as a symbol of their struggle against the \"Goliath\" Medici clan and prominently displayed the statue near Florence's main square.AdvertisementTechnically four popes can claim a link to the Medici line, but only two were direct descendants of the famed Medici of Florence. The first was Giovanni di Lorenzo de' Medici, second son of Lorenzo \"the Magnificent\" (the first son, Piero \"the Unfortunate,\" so-called because of his poor judgment, presided over the Medici's defeat by Savonarola in 1494). Giovanni became Pope Leo X, a free-spending art enthusiast who earned infamy for selling indulgences to help pay for the renovation of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. These indulgences, which promised absolution of sin to their owners, helped spark the Protestant Reformation.The second Medici Pope was Giulio, the illegitimate son of Lorenzo's murdered brother, who took the name Clement VII. As pope, his most significant act was blocking Henry VIII's divorce and threatening him with excommunication, leading to England's separation from the Catholic Church.The Medici women were no strangers to power, either. Catherine de' Medici (daughter of Lorenzo, Duke of Urbino and great-granddaughter of Lorenzo the Magnificent) married into the French monarchy at just 14 years old in 1533. Her husband, Henry, became king of France in 1547 and after his death, three of Catherine's sons served as kings. When the boys were young (her son Charles inherited the throne at 10), Catherine served as regent with untold political influence. Another Medici, Marie, was also queen of France in the early 17th century and was also regent for her young son, Louis XIII. Fun fact: Catherine allegedly introduced gelato to the world, via her personal chef.AdvertisementThe Medici returned to Florence in the 1530s, but this time as monarchs. Cosimo I became the Grand Duke of Tuscany in 1569, and the family ruled as hereditary monarchs for the next nearly 200 years with varying popularity and political support. The last Medici, Gian Gastone, was a hard-partying profligate who died without an heir in 1737, effectively ending the long and storied run of the Medici dynasty.Luckily, Gian had a sister who was far more capable. Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, a dedicated patron of the arts, signed the \" Family Pact of 1737\" entrusting that three centuries of art and treasure collected by the Medici would forever remain a patrimony of Florence and never leave Tuscany.Galileo arguably made his greatest case for the separation of science and religion in his \" Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina,\" wife of Grand Duke Francesco I, a Medici. The astronomer also did time as tutor to the teenaged Cosimo de Medici, the son of Ferdinando I, grand duke of Tuscany in the early 1600s."},

The battle ended Napoleon's attempt to make a comeback from exile, and ended the short-lived glories of France's First Empire.Waterloo was a hard fall for a diminutive leader whose ego was so massive that at his coronation in 1804, he snatched a crown from the hands of the Pope and placed it on his own head. Napoleon was a master tactician who won more than 50 battles in his career, including a spectacular victory at Austerlitz (what's now Slavkov u Brna in the Czech Republic) in December 1805 that became a textbook example of daring tactics.AdvertisementFacing a massive combined Russian-Austrian force that outnumbered his own army by 22,000 men, Napoleon deliberately weakened his right flank, luring the enemy into attacking him. It turned out to be a trap, as Napoleon counterattacked and cut the Russian-Austrian line in two. Twenty-six thousand enemy soldiers were killed, wounded or captured by the French. He was so successful that by 1812, he controlled most of the European continent with the exception of a handful of countries.Napoleon's military dominance didn't last, in part because of his own hubris. He made what turned out to be a disastrous decision to invade Russia in 1812, but didn't prepare his troops for the harsh Russian winter, and ended up losing 300,000 of the 500,000 soldiers in his force. That was followed by a French defeat at the hands of British, Portuguese and Spanish forces in the Peninsular War in 1814. After British-led forces invaded France and seized Paris, Napoleon abdicated in April 1814, and was exiled to the Mediterranean island of Elba.But less than a year later in February 1815, Napoleon escaped from Elba and returned to France. He issued a proclamation, calling for the French army to join in restoring him to power in the name of liberating France from foreign domination. \"Victory shall march in double-quick time,\" he promised them. As the allies who opposed Napoleon gathered troops at France's borders, Napoleon struck first, leading his forces into Belgium with the plan of beating the opposing armies one at a time before they could coalesce against him.Advertisement\"The first thing to bear in mind is that even had he been victorious at Waterloo, Napoleon would not have won the war,\" explains Tom Mockaitis. He's a professor of history at DePaul University, where he teaches courses in British, modern European and military history. Napoleon \"faced a coalition consisting of Britain, Prussia, Russia, Austria and several smaller powers. Defeating Wellington would only have delayed the inevitable. With most of Europe ranged against him, defeat was only a matter of time.\"Napoleon caught the Prussians by surprise, routing a force commanded by Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher, in the battle of Ligny June 16, 1815. But that would be Napoleon's final triumph. Napoleon sent a third of his troops to chase the retreating Prussians. Meanwhile, he led his remaining 72,000 men toward a confrontation with an allied force of 68,000 soldiers led by British General Arthur Wellesley, First Duke of Wellington, who was positioned near Waterloo, about a dozen miles from the Belgian city of Brussels.At that point, Napoleon had a pretty good chance of winning. \"The British and French were evenly matched,\" Mockaitis says.But fate intervened. As French historian Thierry Lentz explains in this essay for the Fondation Napoleon, there was a heavy rainstorm the night before his planned attack on the British, and the ground was so soaked the next morning that the French had to wait until 11 a.m. to move their artillery into position. That deprived Napoleon of the element of surprise.AdvertisementTo make matters worse, Napoleon hadn't slept due from some mysterious malady. Some bio-historians believe was a severe case of hemorrhoids, which may have made it excruciatingly painful for Napoleon to sit on horseback that day as he directed his forces. It also may have made it harder for him to think clearly at crucial moments.According to Lentz's essay, Napoleon's plan was to pin down Wellington's forces at the strongest point in their line, the right flank, and then turn them back at the left flank. Ideally that would have forced Wellington to retreat from the battlefield to the northwest, before the Prussian army led by Bl\u00fccher could arrive and join forces with Wellington.But Napoleon didn't count on the tenacity of the force led by Wellington, who was an expert at defensive warfare. He took advantage of a ridge to shield his men from the French bombardment, and their line didn't break. Without the ability to outmaneuver the allies, Napoleon's elegant plan degenerated into a frontal assault. By the afternoon, Napoleon could see Bl\u00fccher's troops approaching in the distance. The French calvary desperately attacked Wellington's line of soldiers, but they held.\"The battle was a tactical draw until late in the day when Bl\u00fccher's Prussian's arrived tilting the balance decisively against the French,\" Mockaitis says.When the Prussians finally arrived, it was the French line that collapsed. Napoleon's army of 72,000 suffered 26,000 killed or wounded, plus another 9,000 captured and 9,000 missing in action, according to David Eggenberger's book \"An Encyclopedia of Battles.\" The emperor's comeback was over. He abdicated for the second and final time four days later.But even in defeat, Napoleon was still feared. This time, the allies exiled him to St. Helena, a remote island in the mid-Atlantic, 1,200 miles (1,931 kilometers) from the coast of Africa. He lived there, under the watchful eye of Governor Sir Hudson Lowe, who refused to address him as emperor, though he did agree to build him a new house. Napoleon died there May 5, 1821.HowStuffWorks may earn a small commission from affiliate links in this article.The Battle of Waterloo got its name because Wellington wrote his official dispatch about the battle from his headquarters there, even though the fighting actually took place a few miles to the south, as this 2015 Wall Street Journal article details."},

", "An example of Python code."], "date": "May 28, 2020", "content": "If you're just getting started programming computers and other devices, chances are you've been trying to figure out which programming language is the best to learn first. There are many articles on the internet about what programming language you should be learning \u2014 which are the best for what platform, which are easiest to learn, which are the most likely to help you land a job making the big money. If you've been sifting through all those opinions, chances are good you've heard of Python.There probably isn't a single right answer to your question. Learning any programming language will also teach you how to think like a programmer. All programming languages have their strengths and weaknesses. If you're looking for a language that works in a broad range of applications, or just want to dip your toe into the coding waters, Python may be good to try.Python has a reputation for being easy to understand for new programmers. It can be used to write programs for computers or applications for the web. If you want to create the next big mobile app, however, Python is not a popular choice. A 2019 survey of Python users found that the most popular uses were for web development and data analysis. Only about 6 percent of respondents used it for game development or app development.There are many commercial applications for Python programming, but the language has also caught hold in academic circles, especially among those working with large amounts of data. It's also useful for hobbyists.Python is the creation of Guido van Rossum, who had been working with a language named ABC at his then-employer, the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) \u2014 the national mathematics and computer science research institute in the Netherlands. While he liked some aspects of ABC, he was frustrated by how hard it was to extend the language.During his Christmas holiday break in 1989, van Rossum decided to try creating his own language. A little over a year later, in February 1991, he uploaded the first version of his creation to USENET. He'd also been reading scripts for episodes of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus,\" from the famous British comedy troupe. Looking for a name that was \"short, unique and slightly mysterious,\" he chose to call it Python. Do you have to be a fan of the show if you want to code Python? In the words of the Python Software Foundation, \"No, but it helps. :)\".Although he considers himself retired now, van Rossum holds the title of Python's \"benevolent dictator for life,\" a title he's held since 1995. In fact, since then a number of open-source creators \u2014 who get the final say on changes to their projects \u2014 have also been given that title by their development communities.Python is open source, which means it's free to use and distribute, according to the official definition created by the Open Source Initiative. You can also download a copy of the source code if you like.As of May 2020, the PopularitY of Programming Index (PYPL), which ranks programming languages by how often people search for tutorials about them, lists Python in first place. The site, which is intended to help budding coders choose a programming language to start with, changes often, but interest in Python has grown the most between 2015 and 2020.Robert Thorstad, data science fellow at Insight Data Science, believes that ease of use is one of the main reasons for Python's rise. \"Ease of use is an explicit design philosophy in the Python language,\" he says. The time-honored practice of writing a short program that prints, \"Hello, world\" on the computer screen might take a Java coder many lines, but in Python, it can be done by just typing:print (\"Hello, World!\")That simplicity, Thorstad said, makes Python seem friendlier to novice programmers. Many have praised Python code as being easy for humans to read. Where other programming languages use characters such as semicolons to show the end of a command, Python uses a new line. Rather than using the curly brackets that might enclose a function in other languages, Python uses indentation.AdvertisementPython is a versatile language, and its developers often use it for both business and personal reasons. According to a 2018 study by the nonprofit Python Software Foundation and JetBrains, a for-profit company that makes tools for software developers, people are using the language to create applications for web, writing games and mobile applications, system administration, education, machine learning and data analysis.Python is one of many object-oriented programming languages. Objects are sections of typed code that capture the state of certain data. Those objects can be used later by other code without having to write it all out again. The information encoded in the object affects the code that calls it, making the object a versatile programming tool.Another Python advantage is that applications written with the language work on many platforms, including Windows, Macintosh and Linux computers. Python is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. That means that unlike applications written in languages such as C, COBOL or Assembler, code written in Python has to run through a process of interpretation by the computer. It's easier for humans to write and read but forcing the computer to interpret the code every time slows it down. Speed is often cited as a downside to Python.Thorstad, however, believes the language gets a bad rap. \"Python has a number of libraries that are rapidly closing this gap.\" He points to libraries like NumPy and TensorFlow, and compilers like Numba and Cython, all of which are open-source tools that add functionality to the programming language and enhance its speed.AdvertisementAlthough Python can be used for many different types of applications across many industries, the language has become especially popular for data scientists. The Python community, Thorstad points out, is very large and very active. \"There is a large number of strong and really useful libraries for doing common data-science tasks in Python,\" he says. Among the tools developed by the community include:In the second edition of his book \"Python for Data Analysis,\" Wes McKinney, the director of Ursa Labs and the creator of the Pandas framework, agrees with Thorstad that community-created libraries and frameworks help Python compete with other data-science alternatives such as R, MATLAB and others.\"Combined with Python's overall strength for general-purpose software engineering, it is an excellent option as a primary language for building data applications,\" he writes.The worldwide Python community has many conferences each year at which programmers of all kinds and skill levels can get together for learning and networking. Among these is PyCon, which takes place several times a year at multiple locations worldwide. The Python Software Foundation maintains a list of events on its site.With a strong community working together to help one another and build tools that enhance Python's ability to handle large amounts of data, people interested in data science programming can consider Python a safe bet. It looks like Guido van Rossum's plan for an extensible programming language works well \u2014 and then some.AdvertisementIf what you've learned about Python interests you and you're ready to jump in and start programming, there are many resources available to help. \"The best way to learn any programming language is by doing,\" Thorstad says. \"I would advise folks to choose a project they are passionate about and start building it.\"If you don't already have Python pre-installed on your computer, you can download it from the Python site for free. Thorstad recommends the free Anaconda distribution, which includes many popular programming libraries, or the Spyder integrated development environment, which features a graphical interface. If you don't want to (or can't) install the software on the computer, Thorstad also recommends a free tool, Google Colaboratory, which allows you to write and run Python code in your web browser.Ultimately, the only software you really need to write Python code is a text editor, and the chances are very good that you have at least one installed on your computer.Your local library and bookstore probably have programming guides that can help you get started with Python. Schools and universities offer classes in the language. There are also paid online courses you can take, but you don't have to spend a fortune to learn. There are good, free options for beginners available online as well:Of course you should pick the programming language that suits your project best, but if you're interested in easy-to-read code that can be used for all kinds of personal and corporate projects, learning Python is a great place to start.If you've ever taken a programming class or looked at the first exercises in a programming book, you may have noticed that printing \"Hello, World!\" is a common first task for new programmers. For that, you can thank Brian Kernighan, who included it in a manual he was writing for the programming language B back in 1972. Kernighan was inspired by an illustration he'd seen of a chick saying the phrase as it hatched from an egg. His work inspired many others to do the same and now the exercise is part of programming lore."},

", "Parler's interface looks and feels similar to Twitter."], "date": "Updated: Jan 11, 2021", "content": "Editor's note: Since we first published this article on Dec. 4, 2020, Amazon Web Services essentially put an end to Parler, the social media website that has catered to supporters of President Donald Trump, including some who used the site to coordinate the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Amazon removed the site effective Jan. 11, 2021, at midnight for what it said was a violation of its terms of services. In a letter to Parler, Amazon said it had seen \"a steady increase in ... violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms.\" Apple and Google also have removed the Parler app from their online stores. As of the time of this update, Parler had yet to find another hosting service for the social media site.The social media site Parler is the latest, hottest online hangout, a place where everybody has an opinion, and nobody is shy about sharing it. The name was originally meant to evoke the French word \"to speak\" (par-LAY), but nobody pronounces it that way. Everybody says Parler the same way they say that stuffy, front-of-the-house sitting room where ancient Aunt Biddy took to entertaining guests.The main difference between Parler and, say, social media superstars Twitter and Facebook? Parler is, at least for now, a practically no-holds-barred \"free speech\" free-for-all, where just about anything goes. And, at least for now, Parler is almost exclusively a domain to talk politics. Specifically, right-wing politics.So if you think a massive voting fraud conspiracy is the reason that Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election (and you'd never use the word lost); if you stand with the Proud Boys and against the \"fake news\"; if you think Twitter and Facebook are stymieing your First Amendment rights and that Big Tech is out to silence conservatives ... well, there's a place for you on Parler.But, like a lot of social media, you'd better watch out. It can get ugly on there.AdvertisementLaunched in 2018 and at least partially backed by the conservative Rebekah Mercer, the daughter of billionaire Robert Mercer, a big financial supporter of President Trump and conservative causes, Parler was a niche site until the November 2020 general election. When Twitter, Facebook and other sites started slapping the social media equivalent of warning labels on a series of high-profile, very possibly untruthful, and often almost certainly inaccurate posts, Parler's popularity went ballistic.In the week after the presidential race was called in favor of Joe Biden, some 4.5 million people joined Parler, according to the site's CEO, John Matze. Parler's free app shot to the top of the charts on both the App Store (for Apple products) and Google Play (for Android). A host of conservative influencers, unhappy with what they viewed as Big Tech censorship of their posts on Twitter and Facebook, led a supposed exodus of their followers from the big sites to Parler.Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo, for one example, said she was bolting Twitter after one of her tweets was flagged on Nov. 5.About that exodus, though: It really hasn't happened. Bartiromo's Twitter account has stayed extremely active, with dozens of tweets in the days since her announced departure. Bartiromo has more than 950,000 Twitter followers, which may be one reason she's reluctant to say goodbye.\"I am very unconvinced that there's much, if any, deleting of Facebook and Twitter accounts when people make a Parler account. And not just for the major influencers ... but also their followers,\" says Bridget Barrett, a fellow at the Hussman School of Journalism and Media at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and research lead for the digital political ads project at UNC's Center for Information, Technology and Public Life.\"This is a politics-first social media platform. It is not a replacement for Facebook, by any stretch of the imagination. Your friends aren't on there. Your cooking recipes aren't showing up in your feed. Your favorite movies aren't getting covered. And even Twitter; Twitter is still where reporting happens. People are still going to be on Twitter to see what's happening.\"AdvertisementParler is very similar to Twitter in both appearance and function. When you sign up for an account, you choose to follow others on the app and can post \"parleys\" (Parler's version of tweets), and your content shows up in a chronological feed. A parley can include up to 1,000 characters, compared to just 280 in a tweet, as well as hashtags, photos, GIFs, memes and videos. If you like a parley someone else posts, you can comment on it, \"echo\" it with the megaphone icon (it acts like the Twitter retweet button) or upvote it to indicate you like it. You can only upvote a parley, but you can also upvote or downvote others' comments. You must be at least 13 years old to sign up for an account.Parler also has direct private messaging like Twitter, though it currently doesn't have a trending topics feed.What makes Parler so different is its moderation, or lack thereof. So far, the app's main draw has been touting its minimal moderation and free speech standards. \"We're a community town square, an open town square, with no censorship,\" CEO Matze told CNBC in an interview back in June. This policy differs from other Big Tech apps, including Facebook, Twitter and even Reddit, which do moderate their platforms. In June, for instance, Reddit permanently banned its largest community of Donald Trump supporters on the grounds that some posts incited violence. And in February 2020, Twitter updated its policy to begin flagging tweets that included misinformation or misleading altered media. Parler's guidelines say it won't do that.\"Parler is committed to non-partisan free speech,\" the site's account trumpets. \"You determine social discussion/direction, not us.\"CEO Matze has said that if specific laws are broken, the site reserves the right to step in. Parler's guidelines state, for one example, \"We will remove parleys or comments found to be defamatory by a court of law having jurisdiction over Parler.\"But, the guidelines continue ...\"Otherwise, we will avoid making our own determinations about the truth or falsity of statements posted on Parler.\"That means inaccuracies, outright lies, wild and unproven conspiracy theories, ambiguous threats (\"fighting words\" are not a violation of the guidelines) and racist hate speech \u2014 the kinds of posts that Big Tech is trying to curb, with various degrees of success \u2014 are easy to come by on Parler. All of it makes for an environment that can inflame passions to a boiling point, and one in which dissenting opinions and cooler heads are as hard to find sometimes as the truth.\"You can see it in the comments sometimes, someone trying to come in and make a dent. But it's not made for that,\" Barrett says. \"The people at Parler will say they're trying to make a space for debate and free speech in the marketplace of ideas, where the best ideas are able to win out and you're able to make your own choice about what you see and what you think is right. That of course is not what Parler is. It's very close to the opposite of that.\"AdvertisementStill, unhappiness with the Big Tech sites clearly has been a benefit for Parler. And it's clear, too, who's unhappy and what they're looking for. That's one of the first things you notice when signing up for a Parler account: Most of the suggestions of people to follow are right-wing media types like Bartiromo, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, Dan Bongino (who's also an investor) and Dinesh D'Souza. Republican elected officials like Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California are on there, too. So are outspoken conservative entertainment types like Kirstie Alley and Phil Robertson.Their big-name liberal counterparts are nowhere to be found on Parler.In many ways, that's not surprising. The right, it seems, knows how to work social media. From a September 2020 article on political activism and social media in Science, written by some of Barrett's UNC colleagues:The very existence of the site, Barrett says, furthers the political polarization in the country. It may be reassuring to hang out on sites like Parler with like-minded people. But when hate speech goes unchecked, when lies are allowed to spread without regard for the truth, when opposite viewpoints are demonized and debate is discouraged, nothing is settled.Worse, the hope that anything will be settled, at least any time soon, quickly begins to fade.\"I think that there needs to be a reset of trust,\" Barrett says. \"But until that happens, it's hard to see a solution.\"Politicians on all sides of the divide are wrestling with Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which as originally written in 1996 promoted the free flow of information in the nascent social media world and protected sites from legal liability for what is posted by users. The law also allows sites to moderate content: flag it as inaccurate or take it down altogether. Liberals now say sites should be held accountable for hate speech and disinformation, which they say badly affected the 2016 presidential election. Conservatives decry what they see as an opaque and unfair process of censoring posts. Trump has called for Section 230's elimination.Originally Published: Dec 4, 2020"},

Warren Beatty famously played Siegel in the 1991 Golden Globe-winning film \"Bugsy.\" One of the more enduring characters of Mario Puzo's \"The Godfather\" \u2014 both the 1969 novel and the 1972 movie masterpiece \u2014 was Moe Greene, who came to a similar end to the real-life crook he was based on.\"There's an extraordinary fascination with these men in a country that values hard work and a work ethic,\" Larry Gragg, the author of \"Benjamin 'Bugsy' Siegel: The Gangster, the Flamingo, and the Making of Modern Las Vegas,\" says. \"You can see it in some of the earliest motion pictures in the early 20th century. Gangsters were in those. They had a big wave of movies in the 1930s. They drift away a bit, but gangsters come back in the movies in a big way in the '70s, '80s and into our century.\"Siegel, in many ways, is the gangster's gangster. At The Mob Museum in Las Vegas, he is one of the best-known, most asked-about characters in the joint. Beatty's portrayal of him in \"Bugsy\" is legendary, though the film's story was not historically accurate.In real life, Siegel stands among names like Capone (a boyhood friend of Siegel's), Luciano (another acquaintance in crime), Gambino and Gotti on the top of America's most famous mobsters list.AdvertisementBorn in 1906 to poor Jewish immigrants, Benjamin Siegel's early life followed a kind of blueprint for young thugs: A restlessness and distaste for rules led him to drop out of school early, street gangs provided him with a sense of identity, and the allure of easy money pulled him into breaking the law.As a youngster, he and his gang members forced neighborhood business owners into paying them in a \"protection racket.\" During Prohibition, they ran liquor to speakeasies. They fought with rival gangs, including the Italian Mafia. They gambled. Stole. As a teen, Siegel partnered with another young Jewish outlaw, Meyer Lansky, to form a gang that served as the enforcement arm for several East Coast bootlegging operations and crime syndicates. They did more than break a few legs to enforce the mob rules; they, and others, killed.By the time he was in his early 20s, Siegel had made enough money to buy an apartment at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City and a house in the northern suburbs. He was husband and father to two girls and a regular on the New York City nightlife scene. At that point, already, there was no going back.\"Those who have studied immigrants in the first two decades of the 20th century point out that everybody they came across struggled to do well,\" Gragg says. \"But these guys \u2014 and when I say these guys, I mean Meyer Lansky, Ben Siegel, Lucky Luciano, [Louis] 'Lepke' Buchalter, and folks like that \u2014 they didn't want to work. They didn't want to have an 8-5 day. They wanted the easy way out, and the easy way out was crime.\"AdvertisementSiegel was still in his early 20s when he was said to have been hired for the killing of a New York City mob boss, which led to a reorganization of organized crime in the city. Siegel and Lansky formed an association with others that the press dubbed \"Murder, Incorporated,\" a national for-hire hit squad designed to keep order among the crime families. During the 12 years of its existence, the group reportedly killed hundreds. Siegel was never convicted.As Siegel became better-known to law enforcement, he ventured westward, sent to oversee (and eventually take over) illegal gambling operations on the West Coast. He dove into the drug trade and into prostitution, invested in real estate, and dabbled in the entertainment business. At one point, according to Gragg's research, he was making $20,000 a month. That's about $373,000 a month today, or $4.4 million a year.He socialized with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant and Jean Harlow. He was always well-dressed, and described as handsome, smooth and charming. But, true to his criminal roots, he had a dark side.\"He had a hair-trigger temper,\" Gragg says. \"He would either abuse you verbally or just punch you if you used that name he didn't want used: 'Bugsy.'In conversation, even Gragg will say \"Siegel\" or \"Ben\" when discussing his subject.\"What I found from memoirs of many people and in news accounts, he would just completely fly into an outrage if somebody [called him Bugsy].\" Gragg says. \"He had this awful temper. And he used it well. They were afraid of him. They were afraid of crossing him.\"AdvertisementOther than his violent death, Siegel may be best known for his connection to Vegas, which in the 1940s was just beginning to realize its potential as a gambling and entertainment capital.A scene in \"Bugsy\" has Beatty, as Siegel, undergoing an epiphany in the desert, suddenly envisioning huge casinos, top-notch acts, and gamblers coming from all over the world to spend money, legally. That scene fueled the notion of Siegel as the visionary behind modern-day Vegas.\"It's a wonderful scene, but it's just flat-out wrong,\" Gragg says. \"The idea was the brainchild of the owner and the editor of The Hollywood Reporter, Billy Wilkerson, who was a compulsive gambler. He wanted to build a luxury hotel/casino in Las Vegas, and he started it, but he ran out of money, and the mob took over, and Siegel saw an opportunity to embellish somebody else's idea.\"The hotel/casino was the Flamingo, the first modern resort and perhaps the most influential on what is now known as the Las Vegas Strip. With Wilkerson out of funds, Lansky and the mob sent Siegel to take over. Knowing little about construction or how to run a casino, he quickly ran into trouble.The casino and dining room, with the hotel still incomplete, officially opened Dec. 26, 1946, with Jimmy Durante headlining the entertainment. It lost $300,000 in its first week. It closed a couple of weeks later, reopened once the hotel was ready (in March 1947) and soon \u2014 thanks in large part to Siegel's Hollywood connections and his insistence on quality entertainment (Lena Horne, the Andrews Sisters, Abbott and Costello) \u2014 became a success.\"He really did kick off the idea that you pay top dollar for the best entertainers, and you don't charge all that much for a hotel room, even though it's a luxurious hotel room,\" Gragg says, \"so he does get some credit. Considerable credit. But he can't be perceived as the visionary of Las Vegas.\"AdvertisementNo one has proven who murdered Siegel almost 73 years ago. We have murder scene and autopsy photos. We know some gruesome details. A single shot, for example, forced one of Siegel's eyes out of his head; it ended up several feet away on the dining room floor. (In \"The Godfather,\" Moe Greene is killed by an assassin, who shoots him in the eye, through his eyeglasses, as he's getting a massage.)No one knows, or has proven, a motive, either. The most common theory is that Lansky had his boyhood friend killed for stealing from the mob and, perhaps, bungling the opening of The Flamingo. Another suggests the shooter was someone that Siegel had beaten and embarrassed. Yet another, detailed in a 2014 Los Angeles Magazine story, \"Who Killed Bugsy Siegel?\" says that he was gunned down by \"Moose\" Pandza, the lover of the wife of one of Siegel's boyhood friends and his everyday partner in The Flamingo, Moe Sedway. (The theory there is that the wife had her lover kill Siegel because he was about to murder Moe.)The case remains, officially, an unsolved murder.\"It's most likely that he had so angered the leaders of organized crime who had invested in The Flamingo that they had ordered a hit on him,\" Gragg says. \"But the trouble with that guess is that most people say they made that decision either in December of '46 or early '47, but he's not murdered until June. If you believe a guy should be gotten rid of, why would you wait six months?\"I legitimately don't have a good guess.\"And so the mystery surrounding the death of one of the most well-known gangsters in American history remains. And the mystique of the man some dared to call Bugsy grows.HowStuffWorks may earn a small commission from affiliate links in this article.One of Siegel's closest Hollywood friends was actor George Raft, a former Broadway dancer who came to fame by playing gangsters \u2014 not unfamiliar from his own Hell's Kitchen upbringing \u2014 in dozens of movies, including 1932's \"Scarface\" and 1939's \"Each Dawn I Die.\" For a short time in the 1950s, he worked at The Flamingo. He made a comeback of sorts playing mobster Spats Colombo in 1959's \"Some Like it Hot\" opposite Marilyn Monroe and Tony Curtis."},

"], "date": "Nov 17, 2020", "content": "Ever heard of the website Silk Road? The U.S. shut down this infamous online black market and prominent member of the dark web in 2013. Search engines don't index any of the websites on the dark web, which means you can't get there by using Google or Yahoo or your search engine of choice. The dark web is known as a place where illegal goods and services can be bought and sold, and for that reason, it's earned a reputation for being a little seedy and salacious.Sometimes people use the term deep web interchangeably with the dark web, but the two are not the same. The deep web also is inaccessible by search engine, but it's largely composed of sites and content that aren't public for reasons like paywalls or privacy concerns. You probably access the deep web regularly without even realizing it. For example, if you log on to your medical provider's website to send messages to your doctor or to check your latest test results, that's the deep web. Same goes for reading internal memos on your company's corporate intranet. Not because it's dark or dangerous, but because it's not available to see without proper login credentials. Deep web content makes up most of the internet \u2014 by some estimates, 96 percent or more, says CSO Daily.The difference is that deep web content isn't accessible simply because it hides behind logins or paywalls, while dark web content is deliberately hidden by its owners and requires special software \u2014 specifically, a browser called Tor \u2014 to access. So, there are plenty of reasons to log on to the deep web, but are there legitimate reasons to seek out the dark web? Sure.Tor started out as a way for users to communicate while staying completely anonymous, by sending search requests through a vast network of proxy servers around the world, so that anything you view can't be traced back to your computer. Tor still works the same way, though enterprising individuals have taken advantage of the anonymity to buy and sell all manner of vices. Still, people have reasons to stay anonymous without engaging in crime. Tor is useful in countries where internet access is monitored or restricted. As CSO Daily points out, journalists and law enforcement agencies visit the dark web to stay ahead of the news, while lawyers may look for information on their legal opponents there and everyday citizens concerned about online privacy may meet up on the dark web as well.AdvertisementIf you want to explore the dark web, head to the Tor Project's website to download Tor.Tor stands for \"The Onion Router,\" with the onion serving as a reference for the different layers of the internet. It's available for Windows, Mac and Linux platforms, as well as Android and Apple mobile devices. In general, once you download and install Tor, you're good to go, though there are some things you should know. First, using Tor is slow, like the early days of dial-up internet, simply because it takes time to route your search requests through all those anonymizers. Second, accessing specific websites directly is a little different. Dark websites end with \".onion\" instead of the typical \".com,\" \".edu,\" \".org\" or whatnot. Also, sites don't have straightforward, easily memorized web addresses. Even if you're trying to get to the dark web version of Facebook (and yes, there is one), \"facebook.onion\" isn't going to get you there. There are random letters and numbers mixed in there, too. And finally, since the whole point of Tor is that no one knows who you are or where you're located, your search results might appear in a different language, because it'll assume you're somewhere else in the world based on the way the proxies happen to route your traffic.In most places, Tor is completely legal to use, though there are some exceptions, like in China and Venezuela. That doesn't mean you can legally partake in the dark web's illegal offerings; just that having or using Tor itself is no reason for you to get in trouble.AdvertisementBe wary of buying services or products, even those that aren't illegal, because the dark web's anonymity makes it a haven for scammers. Be wary of sites that may infect your computer with viruses or other malicious software that could give hackers access to your passwords, or, say, your webcam. Also, since illegal and disturbing content abounds, and it is still illegal to access illegal content even if it's harder for the authorities to track you down, click and surf with extreme caution.In addition to Tor's three layers of encryption, the browser also deletes your browsing history, erases your tracks and prevents sites from identifying and tracking you, explains Wired. Tor's security measures aren't foolproof, but they're pretty good. Keep in mind that if you use your real name, address, email address or other identifying information anywhere on the dark web, you're giving away the protections provided by Tor."},

I don't have an identity until I have a handle.\"It's as cringeworthy now as it was then, to be sure, but not without an element of truth, and it still rings true 25 years later. For most of us, though, our Twitter handles aren't as consequential as a notorious hacker's.AdvertisementOn Twitter, you're identified in two ways. Your username \u2014 or handle \u2014 is your unique identifier, beginning with the @ symbol. Your handle can be up to 15 characters long. It shows up in your own tweets, in your replies to other Twitter users and in your direct messages.Your handle cannot be the same as another user's handle, and if you try to change yours to a handle that's already in use, Twitter will prompt you to choose something else.The other way you're identified is by your display name, which you can also change at any time, and doesn't have to be unique from other users' display names. This name can contain up to 30 characters. If you're a verified Twitter user, the coveted blue check mark will appear next to your display name.If you're bored with your Twitter handle or it no longer represents you, for whatever reason, here's how to change it.These steps are the same whether you're using Twitter on your browser or in the Twitter app on your phone.If you want to change your display name for any other reason, click Profile in the navigation bar, and then the Edit Profile button, below your profile's header image.

On PCs running the Microsoft Windows operating system, you can monitor all those devices and their properties using a tool called Device Manager.First unveiled in Windows 95, Device Manager is part of the famous Windows Control Panel. Once launched, Device Manager lists all your computer's components. You can enable or disable them one at a time, modify or install device drivers, and even direct Windows to disregard devices that aren't working properly. It is, in short, a central hub that lets you configure every component.AdvertisementTo launch the Device Manager, you can press the Windows + R keys to open a Run dialog box. Then type \"devmgmt.msc\" (without the quotation marks) and press Enter. Alternately, you can simply right-click the Windows start button on the taskbar and then click Device Manager.You'll see a list of the hardware that's installed. Conveniently, the components are sorted by category, such as Disk Drives, Imaging Devices, Batteries, and other self-explanatory titles. Sharp-eyed readers will notice that some device drivers aren't listed; that's because they're hidden by default. To show them, from the View menu, click Show Hidden Devices, and you'll see more drivers, like low-level system drivers or third-party drivers, appear in Device Manager.Now you know how to view Device Manager. What are you supposed to do with this information?You can start by simply clicking through the various devices. If you see any unusual icons, these are clues to any number of problematic issues you might encounter.If you see a gray arrow pointing down icon, it means a device has been disabled, probably by the user. It might also mean that the device is physically installed but doesn't have a working driver.You might see a yellow triangle with an exclamation point \u2013 this means that the device isn't working properly.If you see a question mark symbol, it means that the device doesn't have the exact (or most recent) driver. Instead, it's installed using a compatible driver.In some situations, you may find that certain computer components are malfunctioning. Device Manager might be able to help.Let's say your DVD drive isn't working. In Device Manager, you'd scan the list until you find DVD/CD-ROM Drives. You click to expand the list and see that your DVD drive has a gray down arrow icon.You know the physical drive is installed correctly, so you check the driver. Right-click the DVD drive, click Properties, and then click the Driver tab. Here, you can click Update Driver, and then Windows will offer you two options: you can choose to let Windows find the driver automatically, or you manually point Windows to the folder where you downloaded the correct driver.Device Manager isn't a flashy feature. It's a powerful tool for controlling your computer's hardware \u2013 and tinkering with it may help you learn how to deal with problematic components in the future.You can also use Device Manager to see the entire driver history of a specific component. Right-click a device, click Properties, and then click the Events tab. You'll see a history of the various drivers associated with that device, as well as the exact time those drivers were changed."},

It feels weird that you can be searching for trips to Paris and then ads for vacation packages to France start popping up on random web pages or in your Facebook feed.Is it time to use the incognito or private feature on your browser? Maybe, maybe not. Privacy modes have limitations you should understand.\"Ever since private browsing was first created, users have been confused about the difference between protecting their online activity from other users of a shared device, from websites and ad networks, or from their internet service providers,\" emails Seth Schoen, a senior staff technologist for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). \"Private browsing mode does well with the first of these, sometimes partly addresses the second, and has absolutely no effect on the third. The browser developers have tried to make this clear.\"AdvertisementLet's say you want to use the incognito feature in the Chrome browser or Chrome app (The name of this feature varies depending whether you're using Chrome, Firefox, Safari or something else.) Here's what to do:In addition to the Incognito icon, you'll also see these warnings regarding private browsing on the home screen:\"You've gone incognito. Now you can browse privately, and other people who use this device won't see your activity. However, downloads and bookmarks will be saved. Chrome won't save the following:Your activity might still be visible to:Here's what this means: Browsers typically store the web addresses (called URLs) of the sites you visit. That makes it easier for you to find them again later.In private (incognito) mode, your browser works a bit differently. Your search history won't be stored locally. This is great for concealing your browsing history from anyone else who's using the same device, such as when you're shopping for a surprise gift or if you're on adult-oriented websites. But that doesn't mean your activities are entirely private.Your browser also stores cookies, which are little data files that have a plethora of uses. Cookies can automatically enter passwords, for instance, so you don't have to type them each time you visit a site. Or, they can provide tracking information for advertising companies that really want to understand how you browse from site to site, all the better to help someone, somewhere sell products to you.\"The original design of web tracking features like cookies was based around the expectation that tracking would be within individual sites only, and would not connect separate browsing sessions unless the user wanted it to,\" says Schoen. \"Both of these norms have been violated massively by the internet advertising industry, which often creates detailed, comprehensive profiles of what people do online over time.\"Schoen adds that in some cases, private browsing mode can temporarily disconnect someone's browsing from the technical means used to maintain most of those profiles. In other words, in private mode cookies won't provide advertisers with the detailed information they'd otherwise mine from your activities.AdvertisementBut it's critical to understand that using incognito mode doesn't make you anonymous. It's not a sort of superpower of online invisibility.It won't stop your internet service provider (ISP) or employer from tracking your web activities. It's not going to conceal your location from the sites you frequent. If you're logged in to your Google account, Google's still tracking your search patterns, even if you choose incognito mode. If you're surprised by this, you're not alone \u2014 one 2018 study showed that misconceptions about private browsing run rampant (Fifty-six percent of respondents thought search queries would not be saved in private mode, even though they were also logged in to their Google accounts and 40 percent thought their geolocations would be hidden. A further 27 percent thought the private mode offered protection against malware and viruses. None of these are true.)Even though you're far from anonymous, private browsing still has a number of good uses. In addition to preventing other local users from seeing your search history, sometimes it's good for dodging paywalls that block you from reading content on subscriber-only news sites. And private browsing may reduce the odds that your web searches will be skewed by the algorithms that track your usage in an effort to anticipate the information you're looking for. It will also stop that annoying tracking by websites and ad networks, as in the Paris example we gave at the beginning. And let's say a friend wants to borrow your computer to quickly check his Facebook page; he could do that in incognito mode and log in to his own Facebook account without first having to log out of yours.AdvertisementIf you really need online anonymity, you'll have to do more than use private mode. \"The most accessible options are virtual private networks (VPNs) and Tor, which route your communications through intermediaries in ways that decrease what your ISP knows about what you're doing online, and also decrease what websites you visit know about where you're connecting from,\" Schoen says.But he's quick to point out that these are not magic remedies that make you totally anonymous.\"Both of these solutions also suffer from many myths and misconceptions. Although the technical details of who can see what are different from the private browsing mode situation, those details still exist and users should become familiar with them before relying on these privacy technologies for anonymity.\"With a bit of research, though, you can begin the journey to better online privacy. In doing so, you can better guard your personal and professional life and have more peace of mind on a network that's full of potential pitfalls.Are you a covert spy looking to send data to a foreign embassy ... or just an average Joe wanting to be more diligent about your online privacy? EFF has created guides to help teach people about online privacy, which includes information about using VPNs and Tor."},

Hundreds of millions more run older versions of this ubiquitous software. To keep these computers in order, every few weeks, Microsoft issues updates mean to fix malfunctioning bits of code, add features or perhaps most importantly, to protect computers against security vulnerabilities cracked by malicious hackers.But do you really have to install all those updates? Or can you skip some of them?AdvertisementThe short answer is yes, you should install them all.According to an emailed statement from Microsoft, Windows updates ensure that your computer is continuously kept up to date with new innovations and security updates \u2013 this is, they say, the optimum way to ensure users are running the best version of Windows possible. Doing this, says the company, will also protect against loss of data and information theft, among countless other potential problems.Well, you might expect Microsoft to say something like that. But computer experts also agree on the importance of doing these updates.\"[Are they] necessary for Windows to function? No, not usually. Necessary to prevent unauthorized users from exploiting flaws in Microsoft software to access your computer? Yes, usually,\" wrote Tim Fisher in Lifewire. \"The updates that, on most computers, install automatically, oftentimes on Patch Tuesday, are security-related patches and are designed to plug recently discovered security holes. These should be installed if you want to keep your computer safe from intrusion.\"The Windows operating system checks for updates once a day. Typically, there won't be any new ones. However, on the second Tuesday of every month (\"Patch Tuesday\"), the company rolls out a new cumulative update, which is a bundle of all the most recent fixes, or patches. These are substantial updates, and your computer will have to restart itself before the process is complete.Microsoft is particularly fond of its automatic updates capability, which (in an ideal world) downloads and installs updates while you're not trying to get something done on deadline. But you can schedule these updates for a time that works for you.Go to Settings and click Update & Security. You'll immediately see if you're due for updates, and you can view your update history, too. Click Advanced Options for the option that lets you control when updates are downloaded and installed.It's understandable that you might be hesitant to install an update on your computer, especially if it seems to be work just fine as it is. Updates take time and bandwidth to download and install. Furthermore, sometimes they're worse than the problems they purportedly fix.An April 2020 update, known as KB4541335, made many users' computers virtually unusable until they were able to roll back and uninstall the glitchy code. Another update, released in February 2020, wreaked havoc on countless systems before the company yanked it \u2013 permanently \u2014 from download sites.Microsoft prioritizes updates according to their importance. If you see \"critical\" updates, it's vital that you install them as soon as possible.For example, in March 2020, the company warned users to install an emergency update to protect against extreme security vulnerabilities. Without the update, they said, a hacker could potentially take control of your computer.For those kinds of situations, install updates immediately. The same goes for other updates that Microsoft designates critical.But for others, you can be a bit more deliberate. Start by creating a recovery drive as a backup of sorts, just in case a future update procedure goes awry.With the introduction of Windows 10 in 2015, Microsoft said that it was the \"last\" version of Windows ever \u2013 the company indicated that it would never release Windows 11 or 12, ever. Instead, it plans to simply update Windows 10 for all of time. Every six months, the new \"feature updates\" are released, filled with new capabilities, tweaks, and fixes meant to improve your overall experience."},

AdvertisementIf you're wondering where the ideas for new emojis might come from, the answer is that they can come from anywhere. Anyone can submit a proposal for a new emoji, but there are strict standards and certain protocols that must be followed in order for a proposed emoji to have a chance at acceptance.So who decides which emojis make it to the keyboard? The Unicode Consortium is a non-profit organization that sets international standards for software products across operating systems. That includes maintaining an official list of approved emojis to ensure that they show up on all kinds of smartphones, tablets, laptops and other devices.But if you think the Apples, Googles and Microsofts of the world have simply handed over the keys to the emoji universe, think again.

Instead of bringing it to your local computer repair place, you might be able to fix things by performing a factory reset.If so, you can save money on repair costs, all while keeping your computer in peak condition.AdvertisementTechopedia defines factory reset as removing user data from an electronic device and restoring it back to factory settings. Usually, people factory reset their computer to either fix a problem or remove all their data from the machine.AdvertisementWhile most people only factory reset their computer when they experience problems or no longer need it, there is a case for doing it more often, like every six months.As you use your computer, it stores all sorts of data to use during operation. Some data, like Word or Google documents and spreadsheets and downloaded photos, we choose to store. However, there's a long list of data our computers store without us even knowing. This includes:While storing all this data may be beneficial to the running of your computer, it can lead to some problems. Over time, the accumulation of data will slow your whole system down, which can lead to some frustration. However, frustration is the least of your worries as this data is more vulnerable to being stolen by malware, spyware or hackers.As such, regularly doing a hard reset of your computer can improve its performance and security.AdvertisementSince factory resetting your computer will wipe all of your data, it's best to back up said data before starting the reset.Once you back up all your data, follow these steps to reset your desktop or laptop in Microsoft Windows 10:If you're locked out of your computer or Windows isn't booting properly, you can get to the Reset this PC window by selecting \"Troubleshoot\" in the Advanced Startup Tool.

"], "date": "Dec 3, 2020", "content": "Sometimes it seems like you can find just about anything you want on the internet. Other times it feels like that one song you can't live without is missing from the major music subscription services. And then sometimes there's that situation in between, where the only place you can find the song is in a YouTube video. There are a couple of challenges to overcome, the first of which is how to download the video in the first place. Where do you begin?Before we even get started, it's important to note that this isn't just a technical challenge. YouTube's Terms of Service explicitly say that you can't download and modify (among other things) content from the service without express consent from YouTube, and possibly the rights holder of that content. If you aren't sure, the safest thing to do legally is to leave it alone.AdvertisementThe task here is to convert a video file into an audio file. If you were to download a video directly from YouTube, it still wouldn't be in the MP3 format. You might be able to listen to the file with a video app on your smartphone, but if you're creating an audio playlist, for example, your top workout songs, you can't simply drop the downloaded video into an audio app playlist.Although some YouTube converters are applications you can download and use on a computer or smartphone, others do their magic on a website. Be careful to choose an app that doesn't include any malware or viruses. Do a little research on reputable websites before downloading that converter app, even if you're in a hurry. Some converter applications can do much more than simply download videos from YouTube. Any Video Converter, available for Windows and Mac computers, can download and convert the tracks to make MP3s, but the free version of the software also lets you edit and save video files, and burn DVDs, too. Paid versions of the software add more features, including screen recording and the ability to convert your DVDs to video files on your computer. But don't forget, copyright laws and software terms of service apply here, too. If you aren't the rights holder or don't have express permission, it's probably not OK to make copies this way.4K Video Downloader is another application for Windows, Mac and Ubuntu Linux. The free version lets you download up to 30 videos per day, playlists of 10 videos and five videos per channel. Paid versions remove these limits and add more features. The same company offers 4K YouTube to MP3, which offers a similar feature set.YouTube to MP3 Converter is a well-known website you can use to convert YouTube videos to MP3. Mp3skull is another. Whether it's website- or computer-based, these tools are all simple to use. To convert a single YouTube video to MP3 using the two converters we just mentioned:Steve Chen, Chad Hurley and Jawed Karim registered the YouTube.com domain on February 14, 2005. During its beta test in May of that year it attracted 30,000 visitors per day. In November 2020, YouTube was the second-most visited site on the internet, with 1.3 billion visitors per day!"},

Private search engines help to make it smaller.  "], "date": "Sep 12, 2019", "content": "If you're like most people, you probably don't think very much about online privacy. You have nothing to hide, right, so why would you bother covering up your tracks online?If you're like most people, you probably don't think very much about online privacy. You have nothing to hide, right, so why would you bother covering up your tracks online?The fact is that if you are using a regular browser like Chrome or Safari, and if you conduct most of your searches through a non-private search engine like Google or Bing, then third-party websites and other unknown entities can track your every move.According to a Princeton University study of the top 1 million websites, the web is riddled with third-party trackers. News websites are some of the worst offenders, with an average of 40 trackers running in the background. The most common trackers are owned by Google and its subsidiaries, plus Facebook and Twitter, but lots are also operated by shady entities in places like Russia and Germany.Even if you go into Chrome's settings and enable the \"do not track\" feature, those are only voluntary browser requests. Turns out that the biggest tech companies like Google, Facebook and Twitter don't comply with \"do not track\" requests.Taken all together, a ubiquitous tech company like Google can analyze your entire online footprint to paint a remarkably accurate picture of you \u2014 both the public and private you. Google and Facebook use that data to sell ads, though hackers might use it for perhaps more sinister purposes.OK, so now you might be thinking, \"it's time to make my internet activities more private.\" Let's look at the different ways you can go about it.AdvertisementThe first (and easiest) method would be to go to the browser you normally use and set it to \"incognito\" status. For instance, if you use Chrome, you click on the three dots at the top right and select New Incognito Window. The little icon of the hat and the glasses will appear plus a dark screen (to remove simple click on the icon and select Exit Incognito.) Other browsers have similar features or names.If you use incognito mode on your browser, it means that information like browsing history or downloaded cookies are not automatically stored on your device. But your activity might still be visible to the organization providing the internet connection, like a college or corporation. Also, the websites that you visit might still have access to your information. And those settings won't do a thing to stop third-party entities from leaving cookies in your browser or seeing your unique IP address. In other words, you can still be tracked \"in the dark.\"AdvertisementLevel two privacy would be to use a private search engine rather than the ubiquitous Google. These include DuckDuckGo, Ecosia and Startpage. They all promise to evade the myriad third-party trackers that are spying on you behind the scenes.\"There's a lack of awareness of just how much data are being collected,\" says Daniel Davis, communications manager for DuckDuckGo. \"People kind of expect that when you use a search engine like Google that your search terms are going to be recorded somewhere and they're going to be tracked. What people don't realize is the extent of the other data that's linked to those search queries and the third parties that it's shared with.\"DuckDuckGo does not block ads from showing up in the browser. But instead of collecting lots of data like Google to serve up \"behavioral advertising,\" DuckDuckGo uses \"contextual advertising.\" That means that it only serves up ads with keywords that are directly related to your search terms.It's true that search terms include a lot of private information: questions about personal health issues, financial information like your bank name or mortgage lender, loads of geographic data, and even your romantic preferences.But there's a lot of other data that can be tied to those search queries. If you use Gmail, then Google can collect all sorts of information about your online purchases and upcoming travel plans and connect them with your search terms. And if you also use the Google Chrome browser, think of the dizzying amounts of data that can be gleaned from your browser history. Not to mention if you also use Google Maps and other Google products.These private search engines work in ways similar to each other. For instance, you can install the DuckDuckGo browser extension on any major browser simply by going to the DuckDuckGo website. On their homepage will be a large icon inviting you to \"Add DuckDuckGo\" to Firefox or Chrome or whatever browser you happened to be on. (DuckDuckGo also has mobile browsers for Android and iOS).Installing the extension makes DuckDuckGo your default search engine. So, when you type search terms into the address bar, no data are collected about your search and nothing is shared with the sites you click on in the DuckDuckGo search results. DuckDuckGo uses an algorithm that includes Yahoo and Bing results as well as 400 other sources to compile its search results. (Startpage uses Google for its search results but submits the queries anonymously.)The DuckDuckGo browser extension automatically defaults to the encrypted version of any website. If you've noticed, most websites use the prefix \"https\" instead of \"http\" at the beginning of their web address. That extra \"s\" means that your connection to the website is encrypted, so that no other party can eavesdrop on data sent between your computer and the website. You'll also see a small padlock icon next to web addresses that are encrypted.Oddly, even websites that have an \"https\" version don't always make that encrypted connection available as default. The DuckDuckGo browser extension enforces the encrypted version every time.The DuckDuckGo also features a \"privacy grade.\" For every website you visit, DuckDuckGo assigns it a grade from A+ to F based on three criteria: whether there's an encrypted connection, how many third-party trackers are found on the site, and the strength and transparency of the site's privacy policy.Cookies have gotten a bad rap, but Davis notes that not all cookies are bad. For example, you want your social networks and email service to leave cookies on your browser, so you don't have to log in from scratch every time. DuckDuckGo and other privacy browsers generally leave those first-party cookies alone, though they will block third party trackers as a default.However, you can change your preferences to block all cookies and scrub your browser cache after each session.AdvertisementOK, maybe you want absolutely no trace of your internet activities to be tracked. Then you might want to look at a browser like Tor. As Tor's website puts it, \"Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers worldwide: it prevents somebody watching your internet connection from learning what sites you visit and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location. Tor works with many of your existing applications, including web browsers, instant messaging clients, remote login, and other applications based on the TCP protocol.\" Tor was used for Edward Snowden's whistleblowing activities and for communication during the Arab Spring events.Rather than adding an extension to an existing browser, you download the Tor browser as a replacement. It warns that it will block flash, RealPlayer and other add-ins. It's also rigorous about which background scripts can run and wipes off everything at the end of each internet session, including cookies left by other sites and any browser history on the app.Wired magazine noted that this browser runs slower than others due to the extra encryption, \"but in terms of staying invisible on the web, it's the best there is. It can even help you get online in countries where the internet is blocked or censored.\"Other anonymous browsers include Epic, which comes with access to a free VPN and Brave. In all cases, you download a browser rather than using an existing one like Chrome, Firefox or Safari.If you're still not concerned about online privacy, note that companies like the office-supply chain Staples and the travel website Orbitz were found to have displayed different prices to different users based on their location. And Facebook got into hot water when people found out that job ads were being hidden from older applicants."},

There he encountered a charismatic, 38-year-old minister named Malcolm X, who was delivering a passionate talk on the theology of the Nation of Islam.At the time, Malcolm X was expounding the philosophy of his spiritual leader, Elijah Muhammad, who, among other things, asserted that the white man was the devil. After the talk, there was a Q&A session and Osman challenged Malcolm X, noting that the Islamic faith was a religion that welcomed people of all backgrounds and ethnicities.It was the beginning of a long friendship, which would see Malcolm X through his pivotal rejection of Elijah Muhammad and his conversion to Sunni Islam. And it was Osman who arranged for his friend to perform hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajj was a watershed moment in Malcolm X's life \u2014 a multi-ethnic gathering of peoples united not by culture or skin color, but by faith. This was a revelatory experience for someone who had grown up in a society permeated by racism.AdvertisementMalcolm X was born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1925. It's a lesser-known fact that he could just as easily have been born in Montreal, Quebec. That's where his parents met in 1917. His mother, Louisa Langdon Norton, was a recent immigrant from Grenada, who had moved to the Little Burgundy neighborhood of Montreal to live with her uncle. Malcolm's father, Earl Little, had left his first wife and three children in small-town Georgia and joined the Great Northward Migration, eventually landing in the City of a Hundred Steeples.Earl and Louisa met after joining the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), founded by the Jamaican visionary, Marcus Garvey. Garvey's Pan-African perspective would have a life-long influence on Malcolm's thought. As activists in the movement, his parents moved first to Philadelphia, and then to Omaha to man an outpost of the organization there. It was dangerous work. Earl Little received numerous death threats and one night, when he was out of town, hooded Klansmen bearing torches came looking for him. When a pregnant Louise informed them that he was away, they shattered every window in the house before leaving.After Malcolm's birth, the family moved several times, eventually taking up residence in Lansing, Michigan. There, despite being burned out of the family's new house \u2014 mostly likely by white neighbors \u2014 Earl continued his activism on behalf of the UNIA, taking his favorite child, 5-year-old Malcolm to meetings.In September 1931, Earl died after being cut nearly in two by a street car. Although his death was ruled as accidental, many suspected that he'd been murdered by a local white supremacist organization.Earl's death was a pivotal event in Malcolm's childhood. His mother never fully recovered from the shock of it and the sudden burden of becoming an impoverished single parent. She suffered a breakdown and her children ended up in foster care and orphanages. By 1946, Malcolm was in Boston, where he was arrested for burglary and sentenced to 10 years in prison.AdvertisementHe spent seven years behind bars before being paroled. During that time, he read widely and joined the Nation of Islam, the sect of Black Muslims his brother Reginald had joined. They preached and embraced an ideology of Black nationalism that pushed for Black Americans to establish a state separate from white Americans. He changed his name to Malcolm X before he was released from prison in 1952.Once out of prison, Malcolm X quickly established himself as the Nation of Islam's most articulate and successful spokesman. He worked with Elijah Muhammad to further expound the Nation of Islam's message from Temple No. 7 in Harlem and Temple No. 11 in Boston where he was a minister.His teachings and speeches were militant in style \u2014 he preached that whites were not to be trusted. He suggested Black people use \"any means necessary,\" including violence, to gain their freedom.His electrifying speeches rang true with Black crowds, and by the 1960s, he became the radical voice of the civil rights movement. Malcolm X offered a different solution for those looking for an alternative to Martin Luther King Jr.'s non-violent approach.Under Malcolm X's leadership, national membership in the Nation of Islam increased from 1,200 in 1953 to as many as 75,000 by 1961. But that influence also earned him the unwanted attention of the FBI, which infiltrated the Nation of Islam with agents who bugged and wiretapped members. It later emerged that one of Malcolm's bodyguards was, in fact, an FBI agent.AdvertisementAll this time, Malcolm X strictly adhered to the teachings of the Nation of Islam, including his commitment to celibacy until his marriage to Betty Shabazz in 1958. This made it even more painful when he learned in 1963 that his spiritual leader, Elijah Muhammad, was secretly carrying on illicit relationships with six different women, some of whom had borne his children, violating his own teachings.It was at this point that Malcolm broke with Muhammad and the Nation of Islam, founded his own organization, Muslim Mosque, Inc. and went on hajj. It was in Saudi Arabia that he also converted to Sunni Islam and changed his name again to El-hajj Malik El-Shabazz. He returned to the United States with a renewed faith in the civil rights movement and race relations.But because of his enormous influence on the Nation of Islam, such a cataclysmic shift was bound to create dangerous waves. The FBI agents in his circle learned that he was marked for death by elements of the Nation of Islam. His house was firebombed, though none of the family was injured.AdvertisementBut the net was closing in. On Feb. 21, 1965, as he was preparing to give a talk in the packed Grand Ballroom of the Audubon in Washington Heights, Manhattan, a disturbance broke out in the crowd. As two men tussled in the audience, Malcolm's security guards moved to intervene, leaving him alone on stage. A man in the front row stood, walked quickly to within 15 feet (4.5 meters) of Malcolm X, pulled a sawed-off shotgun from under his winter coat and opened fire. Two other gunmen followed him. In all, they shot Malcolm X 15 times. He was dead by the time he got to the hospital. He was just 39.Tens of thousands of people viewed Malcolm X's body and at his funeral, his friend, the actor Ossie Davis delivered the eulogy. Three men were arrested for the assassination and eventually sentenced to life in prison. One of them, Tommy Hayer, was caught at the scene and confessed to the crime, but he insisted that the other two men convicted were actually innocent. Years later, after the death of Elijah Muhammad, Hayer revealed the names of his four other co-conspirators, all members of the NOI. None of them had been paid, he insisted. They believed at the time that they were doing right thing.In the wake of his assassination, Malcolm X only gained more fame. His autobiography, co-written by Alex Haley, became an international bestseller and an enormously influential work. Years later, Spike Lee's feature film treatment of Malcolm's story reignited interest in the life and teachings of one of the 20th century's most important cultural figures.Family members of Malcolm X released a letter in February 2021 from NYPD officer Raymond A. Wood that they say shows the FBI and NYPD were behind his 1965 assassination. The letter, which Wood wrote after being diagnosed with stomach cancer and wasn't released until his death in November 2020, says he was forced to lure two of Malcolm X's security team into committing crimes, so they'd be arrested a few days before he was to speak at the Audubon Ballroom, leaving him vulnerable to assassination."},

On July 9, 1965, a visiting scientist \u2014 the late Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska \u2014 took a stroll through the Mongolian Gobi Desert. Little did she know she was about to discover one of the weirdest non-avian dinosaurs known to mankind.Her 2013 book \"In Pursuit of Early Mammals\" describes the scene:Strewn across a desert hill, the giant fossilized arms were unlike anything paleontologists had ever seen before. Each of these three-fingered limbs measured about 8.2 feet (2.5 meters) long. Impressed scientists named the animal Deinocheirus, which means \"horrible hand.\"From 1963 through 1971, Kielan-Jaworowska led several joint Polish-Mongolian Field Expeditions through the Gobi. The discovery of Deinocheirus in '65 was among their many highlights.By the 1960s, Kielan-Jaworowska's name was well-known to scientists around the world. A preeminent paleontologist in her native Poland, she'd pursued her education at great personal risk during World War II.AdvertisementBorn Zofia Kielan in Soko\u0142\u00f3w Podlaski, Poland, on April 25, 1925, she was 14 years old when Germany invaded her homeland during the fall of 1939, setting off World War II. German troops would continue to occupy Poland until January 1945.Wanting a subservient workforce, the Nazis segregated learning institutions. Non-Germans living in Polish territory were barred from receiving secondary or higher educations.Yet there were those who defied the edict. From her 2013 book:Starting in 1943, Kielan-Jaworowska took covert classes through the University of Warsaw. She chose to study zoology.Earlier in the war, Kielan-Jaworowska had joined a resistance organization known as the \"Grey Ranks.\" They trained her to become a medic; she'd put those skills into practice during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, a failed attempt to oust the German invaders for good.AdvertisementKielan-Jaworowska credited Roman Koz\u0142owski (1889-1977) with kindling her interest in prehistoric life.A distinguished paleontologist, Koz\u0142owski became one of Kielan-Jaworowska's professors in 1945, after the University of Warsaw resumed normal operations.Poland has an abundance of marine invertebrate fossils. Ergo, most of Kielan-Jaworowska's early research focused on trilobites, ancient creatures related to horseshoe crabs. While studying these bug-like critters, she earned her Ph.D. in paleontology from the university in 1953. It was during her graduate school years that she met her future husband, radiobiologist Zigniew Jaworowska. They were introduced during a 1950 mountain-climbing trip and tied the knot eight years later. The year 1953 saw Kielan-Jaworowska join Koz\u0142owski at the Institute of Paleobiology, an organization run by the Polish Academy of Sciences. It was one of the many scientific enterprises that came of age during the Cold War.AdvertisementBack in the Roaring '20s, the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) had organized multiple expeditions through the Mongolian Gobi, a land rich in fossils.By all metrics, the campaigns were successful. AMNH researchers discovered a whole slew of fascinating \"new\" dinosaurs (such as the now-famous Velociraptor and Protoceratops) from the Cretaceous Period, a stretch of deep time that lasted between 145 and 66 million years ago.Then geopolitics intervened. Sandwiched between China and the U.S.S.R., Mongolia emerged as a Soviet satellite. Few researchers from Western countries were allowed to visit its bountiful dig sites once the Cold War arrived.But the situation was different for their counterparts behind the Iron Curtain, as Kielan-Jaworowska found out.Paleontologist and science communicator Donald Prothero explored Kielan-Jaworowska's career in his book, \"The Story of the Dinosaurs in 25 Discoveries: Amazing Fossils and the People Who Found Them.\"\"She [Kielan-Jaworowska] took advantage of the fact that, although Outer Mongolia was under Soviet domination and closed to western scientists, Polish scientists could get permission and funding,\" Prothero says via email.AdvertisementKielan-Jaworowska became the Institute of Paleobiology's director in 1961, the year after Koz\u0142owski retired.These two scientists weren't done collaborating, however. Koz\u0142owski hatched the idea of organizing a series of collaborative Polish-Mongolian paleontology expeditions through the Gobi. At his suggestion, Kielan-Jaworowska wrote a detailed proposal for three such journeys.Both the Polish and Mongolian Academies of Science signed off on the project. Kielan-Jaworowska was chosen to be the initiative's lead scientist and its chief organizer.Annalisa Berta is a paleontologist at San Diego State University who specializes in whale evolution. She also co-wrote the book \"Rebels, Scholars, Explorers: Women in Vertebrate Paleontology\" with Susan Turner.As Berta says via email, these Gobi Desert adventures made Kielan-Jaworowska \"the first woman to lead a dinosaur excavation expedition.\"AdvertisementThere were eight Polish-Mongolian expeditions in total; Kielan-Jaworowska led seven of them.Besides Deinocheirus, Prothero says the participants unearthed \"lots of tyrannosaurs called Tarbosaurus. They found huge sauropods, and many different kinds of 'bone headed' dinosaurs, or pachycephalosaurs... a bunch of primitive horned dinosaurs (Ceratopsia), and lots of ostrich dinosaurs (ornithomimids), including the famous Gallimimus from Jurassic Park. The list goes on and on.\" Her team shipped back at least 20 tons of fossils to Poland in 1965 alone.Two particular dinosaurs stood out. In 1971, an expedition member by the name of Andrzej Sulimski noticed a beautiful Velociraptor skeleton. As the group dug it up, a second tail appeared. It turned out this raptor's fossilized body was intertwined with that of a plant-eating Protoceratops.Now internationally famous, those \"fighting dinosaurs\" are housed at a museum in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, the nation's capital.Even the best-planned journeys carry unexpected risks. During the last of the Polish-Mongolian expeditions, Kielan-Jaworowska ruptured her left eardrum and went home to Poland on the advice of a local doctor. Three weeks later, she flew back to the Gobi.Advertisement\"As fossils from the expeditions came pouring in, she navigated Cold War roadblocks to establish ties with leading Western scholars, notably those in Britain, France and the United States,\" Berta says of Kielan-Jaworowska. \"She built an impressive science network from her hub in Warsaw that extended throughout the world.\"Although Kielan-Jaworowska began her career as an invertebrate specialist, her attention later shifted to prehistoric mammals.\"Before her work, most Cretaceous mammals were only known from a few jaws and some teeth,\" explains Prothero. \"She found dozens of complete skulls and skeletons of nearly all the major groups of mammals that were around in the Late Cretaceous.\"Beyond that, Kielan-Jaworowska changed the way scientists view some important lineages. Deltatheridium \u2014 a rat-sized mammal that coexisted with Velociraptor \u2014 was originally considered a placental mammal. But newer specimens Kielan-Jaworowska and her teams brought to light indicated the creature was more akin to marsupials.Kielan-Jaworowska died in Warsaw March 13, 2015, just a few weeks shy of her 90th birthday. Glowing obituaries appeared in the journals \"Nature\" and \"Acta Palaeontologica Polinica,\" with both publications calling her \"a peerless role model.\"\"She set in motion a remarkable new age of exploration and discovery,\" Berta says. If there are any budding young dinosaur enthusiasts in your life, you'd do well to tell them her story.HowStuffWorks may earn a small commission from affiliate links in this article.Another female paleontologist who took part in the Polish-Mongolian expeditions was Halszka Osm\u00f3lska (1930-2008), an expert on meat-eating dinosaurs.

She was using the videoconferencing platform Zoom for her presentation.\"Ten minutes into my lecture, I started hearing laughter and giggling. Then a voice drops into the classroom asking, 'What class is this?'\" she says via email. When Wilson asked what was going on, \"a couple of girls answered in unison that they were supposed to be in a high school online class, and they were confused. They asked a few questions and they promptly left.\"AdvertisementBut things were just getting started.\"A while later, another anonymous person, this time a male, started commenting about smoking marijuana and the kind of great weed he'd found last week. Only the audio was heard and he wasn't seen. I asked him to identify himself. When he would not, I asked him to leave which, thankfully, he promptly did.\"She says that because she was brand-new to Zoom, the experience was confusing and disorienting.\"I wasn't sure where the audio was coming from and thought it might be background noise from one of my students,\" she says. \"If I had been more familiar with Zoom, I would have immediately muted everyone's audio, but I was a newbie using it online. I had never considered other people could get the Zoom number and 'drop into' a classroom.\"Wilson had just been Zoom bombed. Zoom bombing is shorthand for when strangers intrude on others' meetings on Zoom. Sometimes, these folks might just listen in without anyone knowing they're there. Other times, they totally disrupt the meetings in silly or even threatening ways.Ultimately, Wilson was lucky. Other victims of Zoom bombing have been subjected to hate speech, profanities, threats and pornographic images.But how could someone just \"drop into\" a private meeting?\"Zoom bombing is nothing more than enumerating different URL combinations in the browser,\" says Dan Desko, a cybersecurity expert from accounting firm Schneider Downs, in Columbus, Ohio.He gives an example: To find a Zoom meeting, you enter the URL Zoom.us/ plus a string of numbers, which serves as the meeting identification number (e.g., https://zoom.us/j/55555523222).\"The problem becomes when people don't have their meetings protected by passwords, and just by flipping a couple of numbers,\" you could potentially get lucky and suddenly enter someone else's meeting, he says. \"Now obviously, you'd have to do that at the right time [when] the meeting's taking place,\" he adds.Just to test the flaw, he tried it himself. Within just a minute or so, he stumbled onto a legitimate meeting ID \u2013 but the meeting wasn't happening at that particular moment. \"It's technically sort of like wiretapping or being able to spy on somebody,\" says Desko.But why would Zoom have this particular flaw? It was exposed partly because Zoom exploded exponentially in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic, going from 10 million daily users in December 2019 to 200 million daily users in March. The company simply wasn't prepared for the rush of people wanting to use it for classes, meetings and virtual happy hours with friends.\"Zoom is primarily a corporate collaboration tool that allows people to collaborate without hindrance. Unlike social media platforms, it was not a service that had to engineer ways to manage the bad behavior of users \u2013 until now,\" says David Tuffley, a lecturer in Applied Ethics & SocioTechnical Studies at Griffith University in Australia, in an email interview. \"Their user base has grown enormously, and there [is] bound to be bad behavior.\"The sudden traffic surge exposed other security flaws, too, like dark web accounts and lack of encryption. The FBI put out an advisory warning of Zoom bombing on March 30. Some organizations have opted to ban Zoom. Google won't let its employees use it on their laptops. It's all fallout because Zoom failed to address its flaws quickly enough, says Desko.\"In information security and cybersecurity, we talk about three things: We talk about confidentiality, integrity and availability,\" says Desko. People want to keep their meetings (especially in business) extremely confidential.Furthermore, he says, the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto \"showed that the encryption technology that Zoom purported to use wasn't as strong as they say [it was]. They're actually using an encryption technology that was fairly crackable.\"It's something, he says, that will take months to fix. (While Zoom has fixed some security flaws, as of August 2020, there were stillreports of zoom bombing.)And as for integrity?As Zoom has expanded its server capacity, it has begun to use servers based in China, with Chinese employees. \"There are a lot of people calling the confidentiality of the tools into question,\" Desko says. That's one reason the U.S. Senate asked members to refrain from using Zoom. The Pentagon also followed suit on April 10.Since Zoom bombing became a problem, Zoom has changed its default settings so that every meeting is automatically assigned a required password to enter it; also, the \"waiting room\" feature is now automatically enabled when you set up a meeting. This prevents users from joining a call before they've been screened by you, the host. Finally, the meeting ID code is not shown in the title bar during a Zoom meeting.Desko thinks these measures will go a long way to stopping Zoom bombing. \"It's good to keep the meeting ID private so that people can't associate your meeting ID with you or your company,\" he says. \"Or if you are a high-profile person like Boris Johnson, sharing his meeting ID [as he did on a tweet as part of a Zoom screenshoton March 31] was like sharing the address to the bat cave. Even though the bat cave is secure, it is now a specific target. The password is then key to keeping the meeting secure.\"He adds that \"If you want to be super-secure you should change up your meeting ID with every call and password too. There is a setting to generate a new meeting ID automatically and you can also set the password personally as well.\"At the very least, make sure that Zoom's new security features have actually been enabled on the meetings you're setting up.\"If you have a [recurring] meeting set up already that used the old default, you have to go back into Zoom and update those,\" says Desko. \"That's easy enough to do.\"Another way to prevent outsiders from hijacking your meeting is to make the \"share screen\" option only available to the host. You also can mute the microphones of everyone but the host or the speaker and lock the meeting when everyone has joined to prevent break-ins. These features can be done on the Zoom toolbar. And finally, don't post a public link to your meeting that may invite unwanted guests to try to enter.Zoom has shouldered an incredible amount of bad press for its shortcomings during the pandemic. But other conferencing tools (like Skype, Webex and Google Hangout) have security issues, too \u2013 so no matter which software you choose, don't make any assumptions about the privacy of your online meetings. Use some of the same tips we gave you for Zoom to make your other types of virtual meetings secure.Originally Published: Apr 14, 2020"},

"], "date": null, "content": "cross the globe, 330 million families can't find a decent affordable home to live in, and the problem is rapidly growing worse, according to a working paper issued last year by the World Resources Institute. As this 2015 Reuters story details, the slums of fast-growing cities in Latin America are filled with haphazard shacks built from scrap metal and wood, erected by impoverished urban dwellers.But now, Austin, Texas-based construction technology startup ICON and San Francisco-based nonprofit housing organization New Story may have at least part of the answer to the world's affordable housing problem. They've developed a house that can be built in fewer than 24 hours, for a projected cost of less than $4,000, using a special mobile 3-D printer that is designed to work in rugged conditions in developing countries.ICON and New Story recently demonstrated the technology in Austin, by producing what reportedly is the first 3-D-printed house in the U.S. that's up to code and fully permitted for people to live in.\"We wanted to build and meet the highest of U.S. housing codes to prove the technology has the ability to build safe, strong homes that can face hurricanes and earthquakes,\" New Story co-founder and head of product Matthew Marshall explains in an email.Here's a YouTube video about the project:In an email, ICON co-founder Jason Ballard says that he and his partners, Alex Le Roux and Evan Loomis, began working together in early 2017, out of a mutual interest in finding a more efficient, less wasteful way to build affordable houses. \"Approaches to construction hadn't changed in so long it was like people had forgotten how to even imagine a different way,\" Ballard explains.ICON and New Story subsequently joined forces through entrepreneurial accelerator Praxis, according to Marshall.AdvertisementThe key breakthrough was development of the Vulcan 3-D printer, a gantry-style device that moves on rails to build the home, layer by layer.\"The key differentiator with what we are doing is that we are focused on whole-home site-printing,\" Ballard explains. \"Many other companies working in the space print in warehouses, or only print pieces of a home that are assembled elsewhere. We believe this surrenders many of the basic advantages of 3-D printing. We have several patents submitted in hardware, software, and materials, and several more in process.\"Ballard says the printer is lightweight and designed with minimal bells and whistles, making it rugged and dependable. The current model uses inexpensive basic concrete as a building material, but ICON is exploring the use of other materials in the future as well.New Story's Marshall says that concrete is more resilient and energy-efficient than building materials such as drywall and particle board, which are staples of home construction in the U.S. And by using 3-D printing to build a structure in layers, it's possible to build with near-zero waste. The process also affords \"tremendous design freedom \u2013 curves and slopes are no more challenging or expensive than straight, plumb lines.\"AdvertisementWhile it took about 48 hours to print the demonstration house in Austin, the printer was running much slower than its potential speed, Ballard says. Once the houses are in production, it'll be possible to create one in a day and possibly as little as 12 hours, with as few as two or three workers.While the printed portion of the demonstration home cost $10,000, ICON and New Story have a goal of getting the production cost down to $4,000 for what Ballard says will be a \"very basic, but solid and weatherproof, house.\"New Story is currently trying to raise $600,000 for additional R&D, and another $400,000 to build 100 homes in El Salvador that would comprise the world's first entirely 3-D-printed community. They're hoping to begin construction in 2018. Medium has a more detailed explanation of the project.Ballard says that 3-D printing is the way of the future in home building, and not just in developing countries. \"I think it is a revolutionary paradigm shift in home construction that is better in every way: speed, cost, design freedom, energy efficiency, maintenance, resiliency, waste and comfort,\" he says.\"So whether you are building a house in El Salvador or in San Francisco our opinion is that it should be 3D-printed, at least if you care about cost, sustainability, and human well-being.\" He says that ICON plans to unveil additional projects in months to come.Another solution being explored for providing affordable housing in the U.S. is manufactured modular housing. A Seattle-area company called Blokable has designed individual units that can be delivered to a site and assembled into an apartment building, with built-in plug-and-play smart technology to control heating, energy use and other functions."},

Tens of thousands of years ago, before the development of written languages, ancient humans drew pictures of animals on cave walls and augmented them with markings \u2014 dots, spirals, ovals, intersecting lines and the like \u2014 that appear to have been an early form of symbolic communication. Flash forward to today and communicating in images and symbols seems to be coming back in a big way. But instead of dabbing our fingers into crude paints made from iron oxide and animal fat, we're tapping the screens of our smartphones to summon forth tiny digital images and icons \u2014 simple smiley faces, hearts, fruits, etc. \u2014 to express various meanings. When Japanese artist Shigetaka Kurita created the first emoji back in 1999, he intended them to be a way to convey more information than the 250 characters that an early mobile phone system allowed. But since then, emojis have become so popular and ubiquitous that  they're used more than 5 billion times each day on Facebook Messenger.AdvertisementEmojis have become so much a part of modern discourse, in fact, that linguistics scholars recently converged on the campus of Stanford University for the 1\u200bst\u200b International Workshop on Emoji Understanding and Applications in Social Media, in order to ponder how the little pictures are affecting human communication. At an event earlier this year, an executive from a mobile phone maker even proclaimed that emojis actually are replacing words, and that \"images are becoming the new mode of expression.\"Indeed, in Great Britain, teachers are utilizing emojis to help children make sense of Shakespeare's plays, while scientists want to develop an emoji for warning people about earthquakes.That's led some to wonder if we're regressing back to the sort of pictorial, symbolic communication style that ancient humans used. But one expert in visual communication says that isn't likely to happen.Dr. Neil Cohn is an assistant professor of communication and cognition at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, and author of the 2013 book \"The Visual Language of Comics.\" Back in 2015, he wrote an essay for BBC, entitled \"Will Emoji Become a New Language?\"In an email, Cohn says that he doesn't see the use of emojis as a regression to the sort of communication that existed before written language. \"In fact, it's a bit demeaning to the graphic domain to think that drawing falls at a more evolutionary basic rung on the communicative ladder,\" he writes. \"Because of historical circumstances, we've come to think of bare written language as the norm, and also transport that notion to speaking (as if speech alone was communication). This has never been the case. In speech, we gesture when we talk, and those gestures play an essential role in our communication.\"And, we've always been able to combine text and image together,\" Cohn says. \"These are not hierarchically ranked systems, but rather work in parallel with each other for the most effective communication. We have done this throughout our history, and emoji are just a new spin on this very basic communicative ability. What is new is that we are now using written language in back-and-forth communication in real-time interactions, which thereby cries out for supplementation to enrich the messages through other modalities, like the graphics of emoji.\"As Cohn explains, emojis don't have a grammatical system, as a true language would. \"They use some basic conventions, like the emotive face typically going after a textual or emoji expression, but this is just a simple heuristic. They do not use any type of complex sequencing patterns, rarely are grouped into phrases (and usually only one level of embedding), and they rarely play roles as 'parts of speech' on their own.\"So, emojis mostly just use basic sequencing patterns like repeating the same emoji for emphasis or giving a 'list' of thematically related emojis. I can't really say whether the patterns that are used differ cross-culturally, but I would imagine that these basic sequencing methods are fairly common, since they do not require system-internal rules.\"Emoji have certainly augmented written language in interactive exchanges, but not so much for formal or more extensive writing. I'd imagine that they only replace text when they can provide a supplement, enhancement, or substitution to the communicative message in text. But, they aren't 'replacing' text in any existential sense. Rather, it's more accurate to say that emoji are now joining text to create multimodal messages. This isn't something new to human expression, it's just here manifesting in a novel way for our cultures in interactive exchanges.\"A French cheese manufacturer is promoting the idea of a Camembert cheese emoji, according to Dairy Reporter."},

If you say you're going to print something from your computer, most people still think of two-dimensional printing, putting toner or ink on a piece of paper. Now, although many people may not have experienced 3-D printing themselves, they may very well know what you're talking about. And 3-D printers have become affordable enough to start showing up in homes, makerspaces and classrooms.3-D printing uses a family of manufacturing technology called additive manufacturing (AM). AM is the means of creating an object by adding material to the object layer by layer. AM is the current terminology established by ASTM International (formerly the American Society for Testing and Materials) [source: Gibson, et, al.]. Throughout its history, additive manufacturing in general has gone by various names: stereolithography, 3-D layering and 3-D printing. This article uses the term 3-D printing because it's more well known.AdvertisementYou can see some of the basic principles behind AM in caves; over thousands of years, dripping water creates layers and layers of mineral deposits, which accumulate to form stalagmites and stalactites. Unlike these natural formations, though, 3-D printing is much faster and follows a predetermined plan provided by computer software. The computer directs the 3-D printer to add each new layer as a precise cross-section of the final object.Additive manufacturing and 3-D printing specifically, continues to grow. Technology that started out as a way to build fast prototypes is now a means of creating products for the medical, dental, aerospace and automotive industries. 3-D printing is also crossing over into toy and furniture manufacturing, art and fashion.This article looks at the broad scope of 3-D printing, from its history and technologies to its wide range of uses, including printing your own 3-D models at home. First, let's take a look at how 3-D printing got its start and how it is developing today."},

Then Knowlton saw something in his peripheral vision: \"a running beast with a saber on its head. It was like lightning,\" he told Radiolab in 2015.Several shots hit the animal but failed to bring it down. The men followed the rhino's trail for 10 minutes before they found it, still standing but mortally wounded. Knowlton fired again. And again. Finally, the rhinoceros fell. Knowlton approached the animal and touched its open eye. When it failed to blink, he knew it was dead.

Dongarra should know. He's an author for TOP500, an organization that compiles and maintains a list of the world's 500 most powerful computer systems.Supercomputer speed is measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPS), which indicates the number of arithmetic operations that the unit can perform each second. In fact, researchers are aiming to produce a supercomputer capable of reaching exascale \u2014 also known as one exaflop (1018 operations per second) \u2014 within the next decade.And the White House could help them to do it.\"This executive order really sets the stage for the work needed to reach exascale,\" Dongarra says.Along with reaching exascale, the White House has several other things they hope the computing initiative can accomplish. Most of them have to do with big data (one exabyte, or 1018 bytes, big) and developing systems that \"drive the convergence of compute-intensive and data-intensive systems.\" By compute-intensive, they just mean a system that can do an enormous number of calculations at once. The data-intensive bit refers to the amount of data, like medical records or Web pages that a computer can sift through.\u00a0\u00a0That convergence could come in handy for studying something like weather. Researchers could pair simulations of weather with actual data from satellites and other sensors. Combining these two capacities would offer deeper insights into varying scientific events and concepts.The initiative also aims to make supercomputer programming much simpler, as current systems are pretty tough to program. The public-private partnership plans to support research on new methods for building and programming in order to address this issue.They also plan to make supercomputers readily available for companies and academics that could benefit from HPC capabilities, yet lack the resources.Finally, they'll work to establish innovative hardware technology to be used in future HPC units. These successors will replace semiconductor technology, which is quickly reaching its limits.All of that sounds pretty great, but why the heck should you care about supercomputers? After all, they won't improve your Netflix streaming experience or make you a master of computer solitaire. Nope, they're capable of way more than that. We can use them to make giant leaps and improvements in the industries of health care, meteorology and even national security.\"More powerful computing capability will allow diverse industries to more quickly engineer superior new products that could improve a nation's competitiveness,\" says Dongarra. \"In addition, there are considerable flow-down benefits that will result from meeting both the hardware and software high-performance computing challenges. These would include enhancements to smaller computer systems and many types of consumer electronics, from smartphones to cameras.\"Yep, supercomputers are capable of big things. And, with the White House's new initiative, those capabilities could get bigger.\u00a0Whenever Tianhe-2, currently the world's fastest supercomputer, is running, it draws enough power to supply approximately 5,100 Chinese households."},

It's a very particular mode of theoretical time travel, one that demands a careful balance of manipulation of quantum entanglement and the right grasp of general relativity.The idea emerges from the field of quantum computing, in which scientists look to the computational potential of quantum-mechanical phenomena. It's the realm of superposition and entanglement. According to physicist David Deutsch, the superposition of qubits (quantum bits of information that can simultaneously exist as a one and a zero and everything in between) can theoretically allow a quantum computer to work on a million computations at once. Entangling those qubits allows us to measure each one's value without disturbing the system's integrity.AdvertisementLest you have doubts about the reality of quantum computers, Google says that it has created one that works 100 million times faster than our laptops. But why dream small? Perhaps, as researcher Dave Bacon posits, you could enable your quantum computer to send particles backward through time along a \"closed timelike curve.\" Think of that curve as a wormhole that loops back around to the same point in space-time.What's the point of such a voyage? Well, blasting information-coded particles through such a time loop could super-charge a quantum computer enough to solve some otherwise impossible computations.Yet this is still time travel into the past, so we have to consider the rules of causality. In this universe, cause always comes before effect, not the other way around. There's no killing your own grandfather or assassinating Hitler allowed.Critics of the closed timelike curve theory of quantum computing argue that causality would break up the theoretical computing party as the time-traveling particle would interact with its past self. But now, in this latest study, a team of international quantum researchers argue that by quantum entangling a time-traveling quantum computation particle, you could \"lock it,\" resulting in an \"open timelike curve.\" You wouldn't have to worry about broken causality because the curve is open, not closed. The locked particle can't interact with its past self.That's the theory in a nutshell, but you'll want to read \"How Quantum Computers Work\" and the original quantum information paper for a deeper dive into the topic.\u00a0"},

"], "date": "Updated: Apr 14, 2021", "content": "We expect the technology in our lives to work every time we turn the devices on. It's frustrating when they don't, especially when we have no clue how to solve the problem. The so-called \"black screen of death\" is common across operating systems \u2014 you turn the machine on, but the screen's blank. Sometimes the monitor lights up, other times it remains dark. Thankfully it's pretty rare \u2014 though it's happened often enough that people have given it an easy-to-remember name. So, what do you do when it happens to you?A screen that doesn't turn on may be a sign of a malfunctioning screen or a bad connection between the computer and the monitor. For desktop computers, trying another monitor or cable is a simple way to see if one or the other is at fault. Of course, if you're having this trouble with your laptop or all-in-one system, or if a bad video card is the problem, some disassembly may be required.Windows users could be confronting a corrupted system file. In that case you might see a blinking prompt, but nothing else on the screen. Another cause might be a problem with a display adapter. Basically, if the computer can't detect a monitor of some kind, the screen will remain black. In cases like these, when you can't even get the computer to launch, you may need to restart your computer and boot into recovery mode. To do this, you'll need to press F8 repeatedly as your computer boots up. An alternative is to use an external drive, such as a DVD or flash drive.If you've been able to log in, the black screen could be something as simple as an app that froze during startup. In this case, you may be able to quit the offending app via Task Manager. One possibility is finding LockAppHost.exe on the Details tab and ending the task. AdvertisementMac users may find that a kernel panic is at the root of their black screen. A kernel panic occurs when the kernel of the operating system discovers something that requires you to restart your computer. Getting the black screen of death on a Mac is sometimes accompanied by a message to restart your computer. Unfortunately, the alert gives you no idea whether the problem is related to hardware or software.If the problem keeps occurring, try to keep track of what's happening when the error takes place. If you can identify a particular program that causes trouble, that may help you solve the problem. As with Windows, restarting from a Mac's recovery partition may be useful in the troubleshooting process. If you have the problem after booting from the recovery partition or an external boot disk, that suggests the concern is with your computer's hardware. If you suspect a hardware issue, check your computer's random-access memory, or RAM. If it's faulty or has come loose from its connection, this may cause a Mac to suffer a kernel panic.Linux users encountering the black screen of death are likely to be running into the same kinds of problems as their closed-source-using colleagues. Broken video cards and kernel panics affect them, too. If it happens to you, you may try booting your computer without its graphical boot screen once, or even disable it entirely. There may be additional ways of tinkering with your boot sequence that other, closed operating systems don't provide.AdvertisementMobile operating systems have their own versions of the black screen of death. Apple's iOS users might need to force-reset their devices, though the method differs depending on the model. For owners of the iPhone 8 or newer models, press and let go of the volume-up and do the same to the volume-down button, then press and hold the side button until you see the Apple logo. For those with the seventh-generation iPod or iPhone 7, hold the top or side button and the volume-down button until you see the logo.iPad models equipped with Face ID should press and release volume-up, then volume-down, and then hold down the top button. For those with iPads with a home button, iPhone 6s or older devices, or iPod touch sixth generation or older, hold down the side or top button and the home button together until you see Apple's logo, which should take at least 10 seconds to appear.Android device users should start by holding down the power button on your device for five to seven seconds, which should restart it. If the device hasn't been charged, there might be a problem with its power cord, adapter, or even the electrical outlet. If the device has power, you may have a problem with the screen. It may seem strange that you can receive calls on an Android device with a black screen. If this happens to you, hold down the power button for 30 seconds, then let it go. Don't touch the power button again for two minutes, after which call it or use Find My Device to see if it will ring. Before you take it to the repair shop, consider resetting your device to its factory settings to determine if the screen is truly broken or if there's an error in the operating system.Regardless of the device and the reasons behind the black screen of death on your system, if it's a recurring problem, it's a good idea to have a professional take a look at it to make sure there isn't an issue that may spell the loss of your data and perhaps even your device.If you have a black screen, before you move on to any of the suggestions listed, check the most obvious first: Is the battery on your device charged or dead? If it's dead, that's the cause of your black screen. To solve, plug it in!Originally Published: Jul 15, 2019"},

Times have changed for the swim/bike/run community, thanks to the fact that triathlon events are experiencing a major surge in popularity in recent years. Now, everyone from stay-at-home moms to high-powered executives gets their blood pumping by training for and competing in the occasional tri.The numbers speak volumes about the massive growth of this Olympic sport. More than 1 million Americans competed in one or more traditional triathlons in 2009 alone -- a whopping 51.4 percent increase from 2007, according to a recent study conducted by the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association. Throw in a few million more competitors in other countries, and you have a worldwide phenomenon. Growth has been steady in all age groups, with representation across the board from tiny tykes to senior citizens. In fact, adults 50 years of age and older make up 13.5 percent of total participants, with some athletes competing well into their 70s, according to a study by USA Triathlon. While it's difficult to state what the age groups are for every race, as they may vary from event to event, we'll take a look at two popular and fast-growing demographics: the 30 to 49 age group and kids.AdvertisementMany people insist that the 30s herald the end of their athletic ability, often inhibited by to the demands of family, work and lagging metabolisms. Triathletes beg to differ. The most substantial participation growth has been in the 30 to 49 age bracket, with 65 percent of triathletes falling in this range, according to the USA Triathlon study. Some of the uptick in popularity among this group is due to increased television exposure of the sport since its addition to the Olympic Games. Others yearn for a new fitness challenge after exhausting the possibilities of conventional running or biking. Still more are avoiding obesity by ditching the couch in favor of intense training sessions, often alongside their spouse, friends or children.Whatever their reason for signing up, completing a triathlon provides people with a reward that can't be quantified -- a sense of time well spent and of course, bragging rights. And that's not to mention the shiny medal at the finish line. This 30 to 49 demographic also has more discretionary income than other age groups, which is an important factor. Although many triathlons can be found locally, a lot of serious competitors choose to purchase high-end equipment and travel frequently to events. These expenses rack up quickly, which is why the average annual household income of triathletes is $126,000, according to USA Triathlon.Triathlon age groups dip into the single digits, too. Skipping rope and playing T-ball is cool and all, but many pint-sized athletes are following in Mom and Dad's footsteps and signing up for their own triathlon events. Kid-centric triathlons are modified versions of the adult events, and they're popping up around the world. Although kid-friendly triathlons are shorter distance-wise and less physically intense, they're still challenging and fun. More importantly, they lay the groundwork for a lifetime of physical fitness.Many triathlons have become multiday family events, with a race held for the parents one day and the kids the next. The International Triathlon Union encourages parents to prepare their kids for race day by guiding their training, reviewing the course layout and even visiting the course site if possible. Parents should also triple-check the working order of all equipment and provide necessary snacks, water bottles, goggles and other miscellaneous items. If the trend of young involvement persists, it's likely that the sport will continue its rise in popularity for the foreseeable future."},

Kiger", "image": "https://resize.hswstatic.com/w_828/gif/shut-down-3.jpg", "image_content": ["Shut down, Restart and Sleep are all options on Windows. Which one should you use? And when? "], "date": "Updated: May 4, 2021", "content": "If, like most of us, you use a computer that runs Microsoft Windows, you probably already know that the Start menu gives you two ways to shut down your computer's operations. You can click Shut Down, which basically does what the name describes. There's also the option of Restart, which shuts down your computer for a moment, but then starts it up again.But aside from the fact that the computer doesn't come back on again after you click Shut Down, in recent versions of the Windows operating system, there's actually another important difference between the two options, according to software experts. They don't shut down your computer in exactly the same way, and they should be used in different situations.AdvertisementIn older versions of Windows, Restart and Shut Down did the same thing, closing down programs and powering off the machine. But in Windows 8 and 10, that changed because of a new feature called Fast Startup, which is designed to eliminate what used to be that irritatingly long process of getting your PC up and running.\"By default, Windows 10 enables the Fast Startup option when a user clicks Shut Down, \" explains Rob Tidrow, the chief operations officer of Richmond Community Schools in Richmond, Indiana, and co-editor of the reference manual \"Windows 10 Bible.\" (He's also written numerous other how-to books on software and technology.) \"This option allows Windows 10 to start up faster the next time a user starts Windows. The downside to this option is that not all processes are disabled from the previous session.With Shut Down, Windows 10 shuts down all programs and files you have open, but doesn't shut off the Windows kernel \u2013 that is, the core of the operating system, which enables the software and the hardware to work together, Tidrow says. \"The Windows kernel is saved to disk, similar to when you put your computer to hibernation mode, so that the kernel is ready to boot up quickly the next time.\"While Shut Down and Fast Startup might seem way more convenient, there's one catch. \"If there is something fouled up with a hardware driver or similar, the Shut Down process does not clear that out,\" Tidrow says.AdvertisementRestart, in contrast, actually does shut down all of the computer's processes, including the kernel, according to Tidrow. That means you get a totally clean start when the computer boots up again, though it takes longer to get everything running.\"Restart should be used when installing updates/software and to resolve any errors,\" Microsoft, the operating system's maker, explained in an email. Some software installations and updates actually require you to use Restart to finish the process. If your computer has frozen or is giving off some other error, you should use Restart rather than Shut Down, even though it may seem to you that Shut Down would be a more complete option.There are several ways to trigger a restart, explains Derek Meister via email. He's an agent for Geek Squad, a tech support and repair service provided by retail consumer electronics and appliance chain Best Buy. Besides using the Start Menu, you can hold down the CTRL+ALT+DELETE keys, click one of the icons on the Lock Screen. And if you're nostalgic for the pre-Windows days, you can pull up the old-school Command Prompt and type shutdown/r.He adds that it's also possible to disable Fast Startup in your computer's power settings, so that you when you shut down the computer, it will clear everything.So, what about the term Reboot? \"For most people, Reboot and Restart mean the same thing. The primary difference with most computers, and Windows 10 (and 8) is that a reboot typically involves the system being shut down to the point where the motherboard [the main printed circuit board which allows communication between electronic components] will have to run its initial boot loading process as if you've turned the computer on from being completely powered off,\" says Meister. \"Restarting, however, involves the operating system shutting itself down to the point where Windows will reload, but typically does not go the extra step of having to go through the motherboard boot loading process.\"AdvertisementIf you use the Mac operating system instead of Windows, it has similar options. Use Restart if your computer starts acting strangely, for instance your pointer freezes on the screen or you've added new software. Use Shut Down when you're closing down your computer for a while.  AdvertisementAll this might lead to another question: Should you turn off your computer in the first place? After all, it's possible to put it in Sleep mode, so that all your software programs and files are ready for you to use immediately, whenever you awaken the computer.One drawback of Sleep mode, though, is that the computer still uses at least some electricity. According to a 2016 report by the Natural Resources Defense Council, electronic devices that are inactive but still drawing power \u2014 for example, computers left in sleep mode \u2014 consume electricity equivalent to the output of 50 500-megawatt power plants, and add $165 a year to the typical household's electric bill.Meister advises using Sleep mode in moderation. \"It's OK to let your system go to sleep during a workday when you don't intend to be gone for long periods of time, like going to lunch, class or a meeting,\" he says. \"If it's the end of the day, or you'll be commuting with your laptop, or will simply be away for a few hours, it's best to go ahead and use the Shut Down feature.\"According to Techwalla, a hacker can't awaken and attack your PC when you leave it in sleep mode, because in that state it doesn't have an active connection to your network and the internet.Originally Published: Feb 4, 2020"},

Originally created as a way for wine merchants to safely pass their product to customers during the plague, these windows have come back into use during the COVID lockdowns of 2020.Buchette del vino, which means \"little holes for wine\" or \"wine windows,\" is apparently a unique Tuscan tradition; there are said to be over 150 wine windows in Florence alone, with another hundred sprinkled under the Tuscan sun throughout the region. There's even an organization that catalogues them, the Associazione Buchette del Vino, which started the project in 2015 before coronavirus and social distancing became the norm.AdvertisementThe first wine windows were actually a likely result of a 1559 decree from Florentine Cosimo I de Medici, the first Grand Duke of Tuscany. At that time, de Medici stated that families could sell wine directly from their homes instead of through merchants or taverns, which led to the rise in buchette del vino.Due to the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, some of these charming little wine windows have been reopened, drawing eerie parallels to the plague from centuries ago. But this time around, some of the windows are offering more than just wine. Food & Wine reported that Osteria delle Brache sells an Aperol spritz, another iconic Italian beverage, via the special opening, while Via dell'Isola delle Stinche at the Vivoli ice cream parlor in Florence dispenses coffee and ice cream out of their wine window.A recurring theme of this ongoing pandemic has been pivoting and resiliency from small businesses, so we send cheers to these Italian purveyors.

She may not come to mind at all. But through the most unthinkable of tragedies, with a courage drawn from her faith and an unwavering search for the truth, Beulah Mae Donald has earned her place. Few have endured so much pain, few have given so much, to further the cause.\"She never rested until her mission was accomplished,\" says John Giggie, a history professor at the University of Alabama and the director of the school's Summersell Center for the Study of the South, \"which was to make Mobile, to make the Deep South, to make America see her son, see his assailants and not forget.\"AdvertisementEarly in the morning of a late-March day in 1981, Beulah Mae Donald was in her Mobile home, waiting for Michael, the youngest of her seven children, to return home. By dawn, after suffering through a nightmare that shook her awake, he still hadn't arrived.A little before 7 that morning, the phone rang into the early morning silence. A woman told Beulah Mae that her son's wallet had been found; it was a sign that Beulah Mae, in the strain of the moment after a worry-filled night, took to mean that Michael was alive and well somewhere.''No, baby, they had a party here, and they killed your son,'' the caller reported, according to a 1987 account in The New York Times Magazine. ''You'd better send somebody over.''Michael Donald, 19, was brutally murdered that evening, beaten badly with a tree limb, his throat slit and a noose with 13 loops pulled tightly around his neck. If all of that wasn't terrible enough, his body was hung from a tree on a neighborhood street just a few blocks from his house for all the world to see.For the better part of a shameful century, lynchings were a constant fear for Blacks living in the Deep South. The Equal Justice Initiative, in \"Lynching In America: Confronting The Legacy Of Racial Terror,\" has documented more than 4,000 racial terror lynchings of African Americans in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia between the years of 1877 and 1950.But this was 1981. No one had been lynched in America in more than 20 years. The killing of Michael Donald, brutal in both its execution and its brazenness, was stunning. It was sobering. It made news across the country.\"This [lynching] stands out as a reminder that, even despite the victories of the Civil Rights movement, white supremacy was far from being banished from America,\" Giggie says now. \"It was perhaps the most visible and painful reminder that acts of racial terror were still part of the fabric of everyday life in the South and in America.\"AdvertisementPolice in Mobile immediately suspected the Ku Klux Klan, which at that time had waning influence around the South but was still active. In fact, some members of the United Klans of America, once one of the biggest Klan groups in the country, watched from a porch across the street as police took down Michael Donald's body. A cross was set afire on the Mobile County courthouse lawn that night.It took prosecutors some two years to finally bring Michael's killers to trial, and then only after a vocal Beulah Mae \u2014 upset further by a pseudo-investigation by local police that smeared the name of her son by suggesting his death was due to a drug deal gone bad \u2014 rallied local organizers and national activists like the Rev. Jesse Jackson.The FBI joined in and, after a stalled initial investigation, finally arrested two men for Michael's killing. Klan members Henry Hays and James \"Tiger\" Knowles, apparently angered by a jury's inability to convict a Black man for killing a white police officer in another high-profile case and spurred on by the local Klan to seek revenge, were convicted of killing Michael in 1983.Hays was sentenced to death for the murder, Knowles to life in prison.But Beulah Mae, still looking to clear her son's name, was not finished. With the urging and the help of the founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, Beulah Mae brought a civil suit in 1984.Beulah Mae Donald sued the Klan.AdvertisementThe civil trial, which began in 1985, demanded that the Klan be held responsible for the actions of its members. The complaint, in which Beulah Mae was joined by several other plaintiffs, was sought on behalf of all Black citizens of Alabama who \"seek the right to life free from harassment, intimidation, physical harm and death at the hands of members of the defendant United Klans of America solely because of the race of said black citizens.\"The idea behind it was straightforward: Not only did Beulah Mae want to clear the name of her son, she wanted all who were part of it to be held accountable. \"I wanted to know who all really killed my child,\" she said in 1988. \"I wanted to be assured ... I wasn't even thinking about the money. If I hadn't gotten a cent, it wouldn't have mattered. I wanted to know how and why they did it.\"In the suit, Beulah Mae and others alleged that the Klan killed Michael for two reasons: One was to \"intimidate present and future jurors in Mobile County and Alabama from ruling in favor of black defendants charged with crimes against whites or in favor of black plaintiffs seeking to recover damages from whites, thereby denying black citizens the right to a fair and impartial trial.\"Second, the defendants \u2014 the Klan \u2014 wanted to intimidate Blacks. From the allegations in the complaint:Among those charged individually along with Hays, Knowles and the Klan: Hays' father, Bennie Jack Hays, a high-ranking official in the Klan; and Frank Cox, another Klan member and the man accused of supplying the rope around Michael's neck.On Feb. 12, 1987, an all-white jury in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama found for Beulah Mae Donald and the plaintiffs and ordered the Klan and six individuals to pay damages in the amount of $7 million. That's $16 million in today's dollars.The younger Henry Hays died in Alabama's electric chair in 1997 \u2014 against the wishes of the devoutly faithful Beulah Mae \u2014 at the age of 42, the first execution of a white person for crimes against a Black person in the state in more than 80 years. His father Jack Hays, because of evidence presented at the civil trial, was indicted for inciting the murder of Michael Donald. The elder Hays died before his trial was completed. Cox was later tried, found guilty and sentenced to 99 years in prison.Knowles, who tearfully apologized to Beulah Mae during the civil trial and testified against Hays and others, was released from prison in 2010.The case essentially bankrupted the KKK. The Klan had to turn over its headquarters in Tuscaloosa to Beulah Mae after the verdict. Beulah Mae sold it and used the proceeds to buy a new home in a better neighborhood.Beulah Mae Donald died in Mobile some 18 months after the verdict at the age of 67. But she is remembered now \u2014 when, indeed, she is remembered \u2014 as the article in The New York Times Magazine trumpeted her: \"The Woman Who Beat the Klan.\" Her fight is now the topic of a four-part CNN Original Series \"The People v. The Klan: The Untold Story of Beulah Mae Donald.\"The most important part of her story, in these days of racial unrest, is the remembering.\"I remember after George Floyd's murder, some people were asking, 'Where did this come from, how could this happen?' Whereas other people, particularly Black Americans, were saying, 'This has been happening for a long, long time. This is just the most public setting, or capturing, of a tradition of injustice,'\" says Giggie. \"That disconnect between those who couldn't understand where it came from, and those that did, is in that gulf that I think modern America sometimes teeters.\"After Michael Donald was murdered, Beulah Mae Donald insisted that her son's casket be open during the funeral. She wanted the whole world to see the crime that had been committed. Her decision was reminiscent of the 1955 funeral in Chicago of 14-year-old Emmett Till, whose open-casket photos landed in Jet Magazine and other outlets and prompted a worldwide outrage."},

In the U.S., they kill more people and destroy more property each year than tornadoes, hurricanes or lightning. And experts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expect widespread flooding through spring of 2019.Flooding is already happening in the upper Mississippi and Missouri river basins. And as the Northern hemisphere shakes off winter, record snowfall and ice melt is only exacerbating the problem. So, roll up your pant legs and get ready, because the best way to deal with floods is to be prepared.AdvertisementIf you know there's a chance of flooding in your area, start now to get prepared.Communication is key. When all systems are normal you have multiple modes of getting in touch with loved ones. But if cell phone towers are damaged from major flooding, or landlines and the power grid go down, you need a backup. Have a plan in place for how everyone will get in touch with each other, including a safe place to meet up in the event you have to evacuate. And then add a Plan B. And C.Stock an emergency kit. Ironically, as water floods around you, it'll be vitally important to have safe drinking water available to hydrate everyone for at least three days. And ditto on food. So fill your emergency kit with canned victuals, since cooking might be out of the question for a while. Think about what else you'll want to have handy, including batteries, flashlights, blankets, rubber boots and a first-aid kit. A battery-operated, or wind-up, radio is vital.Amber Bradshaw, who survived the \"thousand year flood\" of the Carolinas in the fall of 2018, has some great suggestions on her website for other additions, including umbrellas, disposable plates and cutlery, a zip-close bag of fire starter, some cash, and an old-school paper map. Have some basic items packed for yourself, your kids and your pets, too. In the event of an evacuation, you don't need to worry about packing a suitcase with your essentials.AdvertisementDo you need flood insurance? Start there because those policies can often take up to a month to go into effect. That means, if a hurricane is headed your way, it's too late to get a policy. (Insurance companies follow the weather too, so good luck getting a policy if you're in the direct path of a coming storm.)You can, however, have a plumber install check valves on your pipes to prevent flood waters from contaminating your lines. Also, if you have a sump pump, be sure it's working properly. And finally, if you have time, consider piling sandbags around your home's perimeter when you know a storm is brewing.Know your risk, too. Do you live, work or go to school in a place that's prone to flooding? If you don't know, find out now and figure out the best route to higher ground. It's also a good idea to sign up for RSS feeds that provide notifications about local flooding from The Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service.If a flood watch or warning is issued, keep your cell phones, radios, computers and any other important electronic devices charged. If the power goes out, you'll want to have maximum juice in them to last the duration. Finally, if it looks like a flood is going to hit your area, get out. Don't wait for an evacuation order.AdvertisementIt's great to be prepared, but what if a flash flood rushes in before you've had a chance to leave? The safest response is to get as high up as possible, call 911 and avoid the flood water at all costs. Do not, for instance, wade around in the basement or any room in which water is covering the electrical outlets or extension cords. If you hear crackling or popping sounds, clear out immediately.And don't drive. All it takes is 6 inches (15 centimeters) of moving water to sweep you off your feet. And 12 inches (30 centimeters) can float a car and carry it away. In fact, more than half of all deaths caused by flash floods are vehicle related.Even if your home still has running water, assume it's contaminated. (Remember that emergency kit?) If you evacuated, don't return until the authorities give you the all clear. Your home's structure, power and plumbing might all be compromised, and toxins and sharp objects could be lurking beneath any lingering flood water. At this stage, patience is vital. Sit tight and wait for the waters to recede, and for contractors, plumbers and electricians to assess the damage.And call your insurance agent. Above all, if your place is deemed habitable but the power's off and you're using a generator \u2014 please, please follow the instructions and don't run the thing indoors. Failure to comply with that simple rule is the reason carbon monoxide poisoning is among the top causes of mortality post-disaster.While two-thirds of the contiguous 48 U.S. states and as many as 200 million people are at risk of experiencing floods this season, all that winter precipitation has soaked California through, finally watering it out of its seven-year drought."},

Kiger", "image": "https://resize.hswstatic.com/w_828/gif/antivirus.jpg", "image_content": ["Internet security software is available to perform antivirus and anti-spyware scans on your computer system, but with so many different products on the market, how do you know which is right for you? "], "date": "Feb 2, 2021", "content": "Whether you're using a Windows PC or a Mac, a tablet or a phone, one thing is for sure: The internet is pretty scary these days. There are plenty of hackers out there who are probing for opportunities to break in and steal your personal information, turn your device into a slave on a botnet, or encrypt your drive and hold it for ransom. Computer users worldwide suffered 2.3 trillion intrusion attempts in the first half of 2020 alone, according to a report by cybersecurity firm SonicWall. That's a 19 percent jump over the same period the previous year.That's why it's important to make sure that your internet-connected devices are protected by antivirus software. A 2020 survey commissioned by antivirus software firm Webroot found that 83 percent of Americans have installed such programs.With at least several dozen antivirus products on the market, including TotalAV antivirus software, you may be wondering which one you should choose. There's no simple one-size-fits-all answer, but here are five things to consider before making your decision.AdvertisementUnlike conventional antivirus software, cloud antivirus programs do most of their processing on the internet rather than your computer's hard drive. Cloud antivirus programs not only have a smaller resource footprint, but they also can be quicker to respond to newly emerging malware threats, and don't necessarily have to rely on manual or scheduled downloads of malware signatures to protect your machines. One cloud antivirus suite that offers an array of features is TotalAV, which is available for multiple platforms and includes protection against threats ranging from ransomware to adware, in addition to precautions such as checking executable files for viruses whenever your computer tries to run them.AdvertisementOne obvious point is you need a program that's compatible with your device's operating system. This isn't as much of an issue as it once was, since many antivirus software makers offer their products for multiple platforms. For example, AVG Antivirus, which comes in both a free and a more full-featured paid version, is available in PC, Mac, Android and iOS (for iPhones and iPads) versions. Another consideration is how much memory and storage space your device has, since antivirus programs sometimes can hog resources. If you need a product that uses resources lightly, PC Magazine praises Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus for that quality.AdvertisementIf you're on a tight budget and aren't a heavy-duty computer user, you may be able to get by with using one of the numerous free antivirus programs that are available. If you've got a Windows PC, the absolute simplest, cheapest move is simply to activate Windows Defender Antivirus, the security app that comes with the Windows 10 operating system. Another popular choice is Avast Free Antivirus, which has earned high ratings from security researchers and is available for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. But if you can afford it, the paid versions of the free programs often haver more features, and spending a few dollars for a security suite such as Bitdefender Total Security will provide far more elaborate defenses, such as file shredding and protection for webcams and microphones. Typically, as Consumer Reports notes, after you buy antivirus software, you'll pay an additional fee each year to renew the service.AdvertisementIf you're mostly just using your computer to write emails and watch movies on Netflix, then most of the elaborate bells and whistles on a full-featured security suite probably would go to waste. If you're roaming the web more extensively or running a home e-commerce business, you may find that premium features in a paid program are well worth the money. The website for GDATA Antivirus, for example, notes that the program includes technology specifically designed to thwart \"drive-by infections \" from malicious code planted on websites\u2014a major risk these days. Norton 360 with LifeLock Select is a suite that includes a host of anti-hacking features\u2014such as specially designed protection for children doing remote learning\u2014with cloud file backup, a virtual private network (VPN), and various features designed to protect your identity and personal data. (As Tom's Guide describes it, the Norton suite has \"everything but the kitchen sink.\")AdvertisementIf you're a person who finds technology overwhelming, you'll probably feel most comfortable with a program that's easier to use. Trend Micro Antivirus + Security, whose slogan is \"Simple protection against complex threats,\" was lauded by an Investopedia reviewer for its user-friendly dashboard controls.But no matter which antivirus program you pick, online security expert Bruce Schneier says the most important thing is that you install one, and set it to automatically update. \"The security improvement that comes from having vs not having one is much greater than the difference between them,\" he explains.HowStuffWorks may earn a small commission from affiliate links in this article.One of the earliest viruses to infect computers, 1982's Elk Cloner, wasn't intended to be malicious, and included a six-line humorous poem, according to PC Magazine."},

"], "date": "Apr 2, 2021", "content": "We all know Google as a search engine giant. You can find anything you need by typing in the right search phrase. But the monolithic \"type-and-you'll-find-it\" company has also been hiding features in the form of Easter eggs inside its pages for some time: commands that turn your browser upside down, fun pop culture references and even nods to popular science fiction stories.But what do the pastel-colored eggs the Easter bunny hides every spring have to do with a search engine, or digital media as a whole? Easter eggs are fun, hidden references for users to uncover. They can range from phrases to images and everything in between. Think of them as rewards from creators for anyone who takes the time to dig into a product long enough to see what's there. They're gratifying to seek out because, typically, no one knows they're going to pop up.AdvertisementWe can trace the origins of digital Easter eggs to 1976 and Atari video game designer Warren Robinett, who wasn't pleased when Warner Communications first took over. When Robinett's new bosses laid down the law that game designers wouldn't receive credit for their contributions, he took it upon himself to code a hidden Easter egg into the game he was creating to immortalize his hard work. That way, his imprint would be there forever, within the title, no matter what his bosses thought about it.Google has been embedding Easter eggs into its search result pages and software since at least 2000. One of Google's first Easter eggs? That honor goes to a fun Valentine's Day experiment. Google co-founder Sergey Brin asked Ken Perlin, computer science professor at New York University to add a special heart character he created for an app to be added to Google.The website has now been archived, but it acted as one of the first Easter eggs for users to find. In a way it still is, as it's only reachable via a specific url, and only if you know what you're looking for. But it's still a testament to the cool little extras Google has been adding over the years, starting with relatively humble beginnings.AdvertisementFrom there, Google's developers continued to have fun with the idea of hiding these small surprises for users. One infamous addition is the video game-centric \"Konami code,\" which originally offered unlimited lives in the title \"Contra.\" Entering the code (up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right) via Google's voice search will unlock the fun \"Google cheat mode\" so you have unlimited searches and secret features, usually making it easier to play and win.You can also type in things like \"marquee HTML\" to see a fun text marquee effect below Google's header menu. Another fun Easter egg is typing \"bacon number X\" where X is a celebrity (Tom Hanks, for example). Google will return that celebrity's \"Bacon number,\" or how many degrees of separation exist between them and actor Kevin Bacon.Now that you're up to speed, you can check out the following list of Google Easter eggs for a few fun surprises. Each of them comes attached to a fun animation or inventive effect that you might not think a browser is capable of. We won't ruin them \u2014 but each one will return a seriously surprising effect you likely weren't expecting.Google continues to hide Easter eggs  throughout its entire cadre of products, and if you look hard enough, you'll find them all across its footprint on the web: YouTube, Google Maps and just about everything else the company touches. But now that you have an idea about what Easter eggs are and how they relate to Google as a whole, you can start poking around and looking to find your own set of Google surprises. You never know what'll be added next \u2014 so it might be a good idea to start making a checklist of the ones you've discovered.Multiple Easter eggs may be calculated at the same time. If you enter \"the number of horns on a unicorn plus the answer to life the universe and everything,\" Google will return the answer \"43.\""},

Or you need to show something weird on your screen that makes you think your computer is acting up to tech support. Or you want to capture the participants on a Zoom conference call. Taking a screenshot is a very useful tool, but it's not always obvious how to do it. Although there are apps you can use to take and make notes on screenshots for your computer, Microsoft Windows has built-in options as well. Here are the two most-used ways to take a screenshot.AdvertisementThis works with any version of Windows. The Print Screen button near the upper right of your keyboard will capture everything that's on your screen and save it on the clipboard. (It might be labeled PrtScr, PrtSc or some other abbreviation.) Depending on your computer, you might either have to just press the Print Screen button; or press the Alt and the Print Screen buttons at the same time; or hold the Fn and Print Screen buttons at the same time (both Fn and Alt are located on the bottom left of your keyboard), to capture the screen.From there you can paste the captured screen into a document. (Press the Ctrl and the V keys at the same time to paste). To save the image, simply paste it into an image app document (Paint, for example) and save that as its own file. Or you can paste the image directly into an email, Slack message or Word doc.In Windows 8 and 10, you can also take the screenshot holding the Windows logo button and the Print Screen buttons at the same time and the screenshot will be automatically saved in a file for screenshots inside the Pictures library.AdvertisementOn Windows Vista and newer (Windows 7, 8 and 10), you can use the Snipping Tool built in to the operating system. In addition to capturing whole-screen images and individual app windows, this tool lets you draw a rectangular or free-form shape around the area of the screen you'd like to save. The image is copied to the Snipping Tool window for you to work on. You can find the tool by searching for \"snipping tool\" in the Windows search box, although the method for that differs depending on the edition of Windows you're using.To use: In the Snipping Tool, select Mode (or the arrow next to the New button for older versions of Windows). Next select the type of snip you want. Mostly likely, you'll take Rectangular Snip. The screen will change slightly to gray and you can draw around the area you want to cut and save. Save it using the methods described earlier.The Snipping Tool allows you to share and make notes on the screenshot you've taken, but Windows 10 has another tool, called Snip & Sketch, which adds additional annotating tools. You can search for it the same way you would with the Snipping Tool.You can also take a screenshot in a Windows tablet or phone, simply by holding the Windows and the Volume-down buttons at the same time (for tablets) or the Start and Power buttons at the same time (for phones). Check your device's manual for more details as these instructions may vary with the version of Windows phone or tablet you have.Originally Published: Apr 13, 2020"},

", "The homepage of the Wayback Machine website."], "date": "Dec 19, 2019", "content": "If a tree falls in a forest, does it really make a sound? And if a website changes overnight, did its previous homepage ever really exist in the first place? Because so much of our world is increasingly digital \u2013 and ephemeral \u2013 it's not just a philosophical question, it's also a simple matter of history. That's why the Wayback Machine, which features snapshots of websites as they age and change, is such a fascinating glimpse into the dusty corners of the web.The Wayback Machine is a massive digital archive meant to preserve webpages that would otherwise be permanently lost to time. Without this hoard of data, every time a page was updated or deleted, it would simply vanish, as if it was never there.The average life expectancy of a webpage is about 100 days, Mark Graham, director of the Wayback Machine, noted in a 2016 Entrepreneur article. There are a multitude of reasons why these webpages disappear. Site creators move on to other projects. Web hosting companies go bankrupt. Or maybe the page is moved or replaced with new data and content.AdvertisementThe Wayback Machine is the brainchild of Brewster Kahle and Bruce Gilliat, who also founded the Internet Archive, a digital library of websites, books, audio and video recordings and software programs. Both projects are San Francisco-based nonprofits. The Wayback Machine is a project of the Internet Archive. (Kahle and Gilliat also created Alexa Internet which analyzes web traffic patterns and was sold to Amazon.)\"They [Kahle and Gilliat] had started to archive webpages in 1996, and in 2001 launched the Wayback Machine to support discovery and playback of those archived web resources,\" says Graham in a recent email interview. \"And, yes, the name was inspired by the 1960s cartoon series 'The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.' In the cartoon the WABAC Machine (note the spelling difference) was a plot device used to transport the characters Mr. Peabody and Sherman back in time to visit important events in human history.\"In a world where there are more than 1.7 billion websites, with the number climbing dramatically by the day, how can anyone possibly hope to catalog so many webpages? The Wayback Machine uses what are called \"crawlers,\" a type of software that automatically moves through the web, taking snapshots of billions of sites as it goes. Some of the process is automated, but many of the requests are generated manually by a network of librarians, who prioritize certain types of sites that they think are important to preserve for posterity and for future generations.The crawlers don't capture every iteration of sites. The frequency of snapshots differs by the site's importance \u2013 very significant sites might be recorded every few hours. Others might be logged weeks or months apart. Most aren't logged at all (so don't worry, that embarrassing fan website you made in high school is probably long gone by now). Wayback Machine aims to capture snapshots of important content, say, the breaking news headlines created by major media companies.Furthermore, it doesn't necessarily recreate the entire site, and it doesn't preserve the data in a way that you'd experience it with your browser. It may only capture a few images of a few pages, and not preserve content that's linked to other sites outside the domain.AdvertisementYou've probably had the experience of clicking on a link on a webpage and getting a \"404\" or \"page not found\" notation. Now you're wondering what was on the page originally. That's where the Wayback Machine can help.To use the Wayback Machine, go to https://archive.org/web/. Type the URL of the site you want to investigate in the \"Browse History\" search bar. We'll use our favorite website https://www.howstuffworks.com/ for our example. In the results, you'll see a chronological bar graph that shows how many times the site was crawled (and saved) in a given year.Click the year and below, you'll see a 12-month calendar with various dates highlighted. Blue highlights mean the site was saved properly; red means it was not. Click one of the highlighted dates and the site's snapshots will appear. Click on one of those snapshots and \u2013 just like that \u2013 you've traveled back in time to that older version of the site.If you want to make sure that a particular site is recorded to the archive, you can do so manually. Use the Save Page now option to save a specific page once \u2014 but realize that doing so only saves that one page (not an entire website) and it doesn't guarantee that the site will be crawled in the future.And, if content owners want their material excluded from the Wayback Machine, they can submit a request by sending an email to info@archive.org.You can also search books, videos, audio recordings and software programs by clicking on the icons at the top of the Wayback Machine homepage, next to the words \"Internet Archive.\" These can be downloaded permanently or borrowed for a period, depending on the item. Advanced search features are also available.AdvertisementGraham says the most amazing thing about the Wayback Machine is that it exists at all and how much of the public web it is able to preserve, given that it has a small team and budget. (They do use volunteers as well.)\"With more support we can do an [even] better job of backing up more of the public web,\" he says. \"Funding for the Internet Archive comes from a combination of 'earned income' from our subscription-based web-arching service, Archive-It.org, major donors and foundations, as well as contributions from more than 100,000 individual donors. We love being able to give away our services and don't runs ads on our webpages.\"He's sure that the Wayback Machine will become even more important in the the future.\"As the nature of how people communicate and share information evolves, so too, we will need to build technologies, processes and partnerships to continue to do the best job we can to preserve as much of this public information as possible,\" he says. \"All in support the Wayback Machine's mission to 'Help make the web more useful and reliable' and, in particular to help support journalists, activists, academics, histories, researchers and the general public.\"Editor's note: The 13th paragraph of this article has been updated at the request of the Wayback Machine staff. Mark Graham says that more than 11 million webpages referenced in Wikipedia articles have gone bad over the years (in other words, they now return a 404 or \"Page not found\"). Because they had been archived in the Wayback Machine, techs there were able to edit those Wikipedia pages, so the references now point to archived versions of those defunct URLs."},

But on a regular Tuesday afternoon, we'd better be able to find our favorite brand of cookies. That's why at night, almost like magical elves, store employees work to restock shelves. With nimble fingers, these elves fill freezer cases to the brim and stock the shelves so that it looks as if no one visited the store the day before. This task is crucial for maintaining customer loyalty; after all, hell hath no fury like a woman who can't get her toaster waffles.Fish stocking works under the same principle, though of course the details are a little different. It's a fish management tool that works by releasing fish, usually bred in hatcheries, into the wild. Just like grocery items, it seems, the public has a demand for fish. Most often, the irate shoppers are replaced by angry anglers who want to be able to fish for sport. In other instances, environmentalists are the ones who want to restock empty waters to mitigate for past losses due to habitat disturbances or to restore historic populations. Sometimes, the customer is someone with a backyard pond, while at other times, the customer is a scientist who wants to conduct research.Advertisement\u00adThe guidelines for stocking fish vary by location, with different countries and states having their own rules about which fish can be stocked where by whom. But whether it's a governmental office or a backyard enthusiast doing the stocking, careful planning is essential. After all, if a grocery store didn't plan its restocking schedule, the shelves might end up with no bread but hundreds of cans of peas. Imagine if two shoppers got into a brawl over that last loaf of bread, and you can start to imagine what might happen in an inappropriately planned fish stocking. While the shoppers may eventually settle the matter, the fish would die.So what questions need to be considered to keep those fish alive?

Known as an explorer, farmer, inventor, writer, and more, the Scottish-born naturalist made a lasting impact on the landscape of the United States, and his legacy lives on in all corners of the country.Born on April 21, 1838 in Dunbar, Scotland, Muir immigrated to the U.S. with his family at the age of 11, first settling in Fountain Lake, Wisconsin, and then relocating to Hickory Hill, a farm near the city of Portage, Wisconsin. Muir learned discipline at an early age: His father insisted that he and his younger brother work the family land each day, and as the young Muir explored the surrounding countryside, he developed an affinity for the natural world.But Muir also had a taste for innovation, and as a young man, began inventing various tools and objects, including a device that literally tipped him out of bed before dawn. In his memoir, Muir described the \"early rising machine\" as \"a timekeeper which would tell the day of the week and the day of the month, as well as strike like a common clock and point out the hours; also ... have an attachment whereby it could be connected with a bedstead to set me on my feet at any hour in the morning; also to start fires, light lamps, etc.\"Muir first drew attention for his imaginative creations when he took his inventions to the state fair in Madison, in 1860. Later that year, he started his education at the University of Wisconsin, but left school three years later to travel \u2014 his goal was to explore the raw, untouched land of the northern states.Muir sustained an injury in 1867 that changed the course of his life \u2014 while working at a carriage parts shop in Indianapolis, an awl pierced his right eye and he temporarily lost sight in both eyes. The fear of permanently losing his vision spurred Muir to shift gears, personally and professionally \u2014 he abandoned the industrial world and decided to further explore Earth's natural wonders instead. Some speculate that it was while he was recovering from his injury that he first heard about Yosemite.AdvertisementHarold Wood, a John Muir scholar, presenter and author, who is also a long-time environmental activist in numerous organizations, says that once Muir recovered, he walked a thousand miles from Indianapolis to the Gulf of Mexico, sailed to Cuba, and later Panama, and eventually landed in San Francisco in March 1868. California became his new home, and from 1868 to 1874, he lived in Yosemite on and off, an experience, according to Tony Perrottet at Smithsonian Magazine, \"that transformed him into a successor to Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson.\" During his time in Yosemite, Muir conceived of a \"then-controversial theory of the glaciation of Yosemite Valley\" and began to make a name for himself as a conservationist.\"The mindset of the 19th century was progress,\" Wood says. \"That meant the development and extraction of natural resources at all costs. Muir was practically unique in his views that wild places and natural resources should be protected for future generations.\"Muir began authoring a series of articles in 1874 known as \"Studies in the Sierra\" and left Yosemite to pursue his passion for writing in the Bay Area, traveling often to locations such as Alaska. He married Louisa (Louie) Wanda Strentzel in 1880 and the couple moved to Martinez, California, to raise their two daughters, Wanda and Helen. For the next decade, he worked with his father-in-law to manage the family fruit ranch, but eventually turned his sights back to travel and conservation efforts. Muir continued writing and drawing attention to issues like the devastation of mountain meadows and forests, and in partnership with Century Magazine editor Robert Underwood Johnson, Muir pushed for the eventual passage of an 1890 act in Congress that created Yosemite National Park.Wood says Muir was also personally involved in the creation of Sequoia, Mount Rainier, Petrified Forest and Grand Canyon national parks and earned the title of \"Father of Our National Park System.\"\"His words and deeds significantly influenced President Theodore Roosevelt's innovative conservation programs, which included establishing the first National Monuments by Presidential Proclamation, and Yosemite National Park and national forests by congressional action. One of the earliest national monuments established by President Roosevelt was Petrified Forest in Arizona, at Muir's urging,\" he notes.One fact Wood says most people don't know about Muir's legacy is that when Yosemite National Park was established in 1890, \"Yosemite Valley was not included in the park boundaries \u2014 nor was the famous Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias. Yosemite Valley had been given to the State of California by a federal land grant by Abraham Lincoln in the middle of the U.S. Civil War,\" Wood says. \"In many ways, it was mismanaged by the State of California which had trouble keeping out squatters and responsibly managing tourism, allowing wildflower meadows to be destroyed by sheep and cattle.\"AdvertisementWood also says that Muir had the foresight to realize that he couldn't push for continued conservation advocacy alone, and that collective action would be necessary for an enduring impact on environmental protection. \"That is why he agreed, in 1892, to attend the Sierra Club's organizational meeting, and agreed to become the first president of the Sierra Club, an office he held until his death in 1914,\" Wood says. \"He was glad to be part of such an organization because, in his words, 'We will be able to do something for wildness and make the mountains glad.'\"Described on its website as \"the most enduring and influential grassroots environmental organization in the United States,\" the Sierra Club continues to \"amplify the power of our 3.8 million members and supporters to defend everyone's right to a healthy world.\" The organization's national community of volunteers, advocates, and grassroots activists have secured the protection for 439 parks and monuments, won the passage of the Clean Air and Endangered Species Acts, and put over 281 coal plants on the path to replacement with clean energy, among other accomplishments.According to Wood, Muir spent many long years advocating for the return of Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove from California state management to be incorporated in the Yosemite National Park. \"In fact, this was really the first campaign for the early Sierra Club,\" he says. \"To this end, in 1898 the Sierra Club set up a public 'reading room' within the Valley, staffed by Muir's young colleague, William E. Colby, to help people enjoy Yosemite and to learn more about the region. In 1904, the Club built a stone visitor center in the valley, now named the Yosemite Conservation Heritage Center.\"Despite those efforts, it wasn't until 1906 \u2014 after a 17-year campaign spearheaded by Muir and the Sierra Club \u2014 that President Roosevelt signed federal legislation to return Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove to become part of the Yosemite National Park.\"As the Sierra Club's first president, his leadership inspired many efforts that came even after his death, such as the establishment of the National Park Service in 1916, and the Wilderness Preservation System in 1964,\" Wood says. \"His writings inspired generations of conservationists like National Park Service's first director Stephen Mather, author of the Wilderness Act, Howard Zahniser, famed photographer Ansel Adams, conservationist David Brower, and many more. This included a generation of grassroots activists throughout the 20th century who were inspired by Muir's legacy to establish a series of additional National Parks and Monuments, and many new units in the National Wilderness Preservation System.\"While Muir's last battle to prevent the damming of the Hetch Hetchy Valley within Yosemite National Park failed, Wood says his fight made a lasting impact on societal attitudes toward conservation efforts. \"That lost battle ultimately resulted in a widespread conviction that our national parks should be held inviolate. Many proposals to dam our national parks since that time have been stopped because of the efforts of citizens inspired by John Muir, and today there are legitimate proposals to restore Hetch Hetchy, while still preserving San Francisco's water supply from the Tuolumne River. Today, there is a growing movement to remove dams which destroy native fisheries like salmon and steelhead and natural ecosystems, such as the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams in the Olympic Peninsula in Washington State.\"IN 1914, a year after losing the battle to protect the Hetch Hetchy, Muir died in Los Angeles following a short illness. \"Perhaps his greatest legacy is not even wilderness preservation or national parks as such, but his teaching us the essential characteristic of the science of ecology, the interrelatedness of all living things,\" Wood says. \"He summed it up nicely in his often quoted verse: 'When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the Universe.'\"In recent years, Muir's reputation has been tarnished as derogatory remarks he made about Native Americans have received renewed scrutiny. \"Most media articles, when discussing Muir's views about Native Americans, ignore Muir's admiration for Alaska Natives and his charity work for southern California Indians,\" Wood says. He wrote about the topic in an essay for the John Muir Global Network, noting: \"When one actually reads the bulk of Muir's writings rather than cherry-picking a few quotes, Muir's writings reflect a concern about how the Native tribes in California had been defiled and degraded by white culture, beginning with the Spanish and Mexicans, long before white American settlers came.\""},

He was called \"the most famous North American Indian of all time,\" by one of his biographers.Geronimo's life story often veers from his legend: He was depicted in U.S. and Mexican culture as a frighteningly fierce warrior and as a representative of bravery for the World War II paratroopers who yelled his name as they jumped from planes. He was called \"the most famous North American Indian of all time,\" by one of his biographers.But in reality, Geronimo was less of a mythic figure to his people. In fact, he was relatively unknown outside the Chiricahua Apache until he reached middle age, according to The Washington Post.\"In our tribe, Geronimo was not a very important person,\" says Michael Darrow, Fort Sill Apache tribal historian. \"He was not a chief.\" A century ago, Geronimo wouldn't have been a big deal to the tribe.Yet to many Americans in the 19th century, Geronimo epitomized the trope of the fierce warrior Indian. He represented the rhetoric that could be used to justify \"protecting\" settlers by moving Indians onto reservations. And that rhetoric was applied to the Apache more generally.\"One of the things that is very common in writing about Apache is to use the term warriors,\" Darrow says. However, the Apache language doesn't have a term that translates to warrior. \"History books, and as a result, the popular portrayal of Apache in books and movies, are that Apache are fierce and warlike.\"Geronimo's own telling of his childhood offers a different story.AdvertisementThere are two tales about when and where Geronimo was born. According to Robert M. Utley, historian and author of \"Geronimo,\" it was in 1823 in the upper Gila River Valley in what is now New Mexico. But when Geronimo told his life story as an octogenarian in \"Geronimo's Story of His Life: As Told to S.M. Barrett, he said he was born in what's now Arizona in 1829. Either way, the territory would have been part of Mexico until the 1848 Mexican Cession following the Mexican-American War and the 1854 Gadsden Purchase.What's not disputed is that Geronimo was born into the Bedonkohe band of the Chiricahua Apache tribe and was named Goyahkla, which means the \"one who yawns.\" He was the fourth child of a family with four boys and four girls. In \"Geronimo's Story of His Life: As Told to S.M. Barrett,\" he described his homeland around the headwaters of the Gila River:Geronimo recounts a childhood spent cultivating crops, harvesting wild-growing tobacco, grinding corn, and taking trips to gather nuts and berries. Around the age of 8 or 10, he joined in \"the chase,\" hunting buffalo, deer, antelope and elk, slaughtering only those the tribe needed. He reported having killed many bears with a spear and mountain lions with arrows.Importantly, Geronimo says that as a youth, he never saw a missionary or a priest. \"We had never seen a white man.\"AdvertisementIn 1858, the Bedonkohe Apache went south to Old Mexico, camping just outside a town the Indians called Kaskiyeh, and going in each day to trade. Women and children remained at the camp. One afternoon, upon returning, the tribesmen learned that Mexican troops had attacked the camp, killed all of the guards, captured the ponies and weapons, and killed many of the women and children. Among the victims were Geronimo's mother, his wife Alope and their three children. From his biography:A few days later, the tribe returned to its own settlement. Chief Mangus-Colorado (or Mangas Coloradas), called a council. The Bedonkohe were determined to \"take the warpath\" against Mexico. Geronimo was sent to ask neighboring tribes to help, receiving it from the Chokonen Apache led by Cochise and the Nedni Apache led by Whoa.Geronimo spent the next quarter-century \"attacking and evading both Mexican and U.S. troops, vowing to kill as many white men as he could,\" according to Smithsonian Magazine.But it would be a mistake to think of Geronimo as a patriot chief fighting for the preservation of his homeland, Utley explains in an email. \"Wrong on all counts. He wasn't a patriot, or a chief or fighting for his homeland.\" He was fighting for his own cause.AdvertisementDuring the second half of the 19th century, with the takeover of the American Southwest and American westward expansion, the U.S. government forced Apache onto reservations. Geronimo left the San Carlos Reservation in Arizona to which he had been assigned multiple times, resisting capture by and fighting against U.S. soldiers and Mexican alike.\"Geronimo's actions kept the Chiricahuas constantly riled up as long as he was on the San Carlos Reservation,\" Utley says. \"If I were to indulge in modern politics, I would compare him to a national leader who keeps the public pot boiling. The Chiricahua trajectory was altered to the effect that they were all sent to Florida because of Geronimo, but didn't deserve it.\"For many years, Geronimo and the Apache \"violently resisted the influx of the white settlers,\" according to History. Legend has it that he earned his nickname from Mexican soldiers crying out to St. Jerome when facing him. In fact, his notoriety among white settlers was such that they would threaten their children that Geronimo would come for them if they were bad.During his years eluding the U.S. government, Geronimo achieved significant coverage in newspapers. \"Some were mere rumors or fabrications, but the stories were bad enough to brand this man a bloody butcher who shot, lanced or knifed dozens of victims throughout his adult life,\" Utley writes in his book. \"[T]he public at large knew the name to stand for terrible atrocities.\"AdvertisementBefore the U.S. government's decision to move all Native Americans in the Southwest to reservations in the 1870s, Geronimo said the greatest wrong ever done to his tribe was in 1863 when chief Mangus-Colorado agreed to a peace treaty with the U.S. General Joseph Rodman West at Apache Tejo, New Mexico, (Fort McLane) in exchange for provisions for his people. Mangus-Colorado took about half of the tribe to New Mexico, where, instead of peace, they were taken into custody. West ordered the chief's execution and he was tortured and killed that night for trying to escape.Geronimo and his followers fled for the mountains out of fear. U.S. troops continually attacked their camps until he was taken as a prisoner of war on the San Carlos Reservation. But in 1885, Geronimo and 135 followers, including men, women and children, broke out and avoided capture for nearly a year.They were pursued for months by as many as 5,000 U.S. soldiers and 3,000 Mexicans led by U.S. General George R. Crook. However, they escaped once again. The pursuit was taken up again by General Nelson Miles, who eventually forced Geronimo to turn himself in near Fort Bowie on Sept. 4, 1886. By that time, the Apache were simply exhausted and outnumbered. His \"surrender\" is said to have ended the American-Indian Wars.But in Geronimo's mind, he had met with Miles to negotiate a treaty, not surrender. For Miles, claiming to be the military leader who got Geronimo to surrender offered more prestige. \"It was certainly not an unconditional surrender as it had been portrayed,\" Darrow says.After the surrender, Geronimo and 400 Apache were sent to Fort Pickens, Florida, on Sept. 8, 1886. After a few years, they were moved to Alabama and finally to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, in 1894.\"Before the imprisonment, Geronimo doesn't seem to have done much to try to benefit the tribe as a whole,\" explains Darrow. Once the tribe was imprisoned, he did utilize what influence he had to try to get them released. Initially, the Apache had been promised they would not be imprisoned more than two years and would be given their own reservation and homeland. But when Darrow's grandmother was born in 1892, she was a POW in Alabama.AdvertisementGeronimo lived at Fort Sill from 1894 until his death Feb. 17, 1909. During his years on the Oklahoma reservation, Geronimo left for participation in Pawnee Bill's Wild West show, billed as \"The Worst Indian That Ever Lived.\" He took part in the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904 and participated in President Theodore Roosevelt's inauguration, where he was put on display even though his requests for the return of Chiricahua land were denied.In February 1909, Geronimo fell off his horse on the way back to Fort Sill from Lawton, Oklahoma, at night. He was found the following morning and developed a cold, which turned into pneumonia. Within the week, he was dead. Still a prisoner of war, Geronimo was buried at Fort Sill.His legend was a sort of excuse for keeping the tribe as POWs for nearly 30 years, according to Darrow.\"Nobody was willing to risk their reputation allowing Geronimo to be free,\" he says. It was in the political interest of the United States government to keep them imprisoned and portray them as a fierce, aggressive people who were potentially dangerous.Geronimo dedicated his 1906 autobiography to President Theodore Roosevelt, listing a few reasons for doing so, including \"because I believe that he is fair-minded and will cause my people to receive justice in the future.\" The Fort Sill Chiracahua were not released until 1914, two presidents later."},

It would be one of the last of this kind of royal marriages in history \u2014 a type of union that had knitted together the continent for 1,000 years.In November 1947, a dynastic union\u00a0was forged between the royal houses of Greece and Great Britain. It would be one of the last of this kind of royal marriages in history \u2014 a type of union that had knitted together the continent for 1,000 years.When Philip, prince of Greece and Denmark married Elizabeth, princess of Great Britain, they reconnected two bloodlines descended from Queen Victoria. But they also renewed a kinship tie between Britain and Denmark that had been joined together numerous times, from Canute and Aelfgifu in 1015 to Edward VII and Alexandra in 1863.For centuries, almost every European monarchy maintained diplomatic relationships with its neighbors through dynastic marriages, in a system that persisted all the way up to the 1930s, then rapidly faded away in the postwar era.In stark contrast, before the second world war this practice was the absolute norm \u2014 particularly seen in the dense web of\u00a0 intermarriages between the royal families of Sweden, Denmark and Norway in the earlier decades of the 20th century.One of the great dreams of Queen Victoria and her husband Prince Albert \u2014 themselves the product of\u00a0 close dynastic union, as first cousins \u2014 was to unite the continent of Europe through kinship relations, hoping that close cousins would be less likely to go to war with one another.This proved to be politically naive \u2014 disastrously so. The Great War that followed not long after Victoria's death pitted the forces of \"Cousin Nicky\" (Tsar Nicholas of Russia) and \"Cousin Georgie\" (King George V of Great Britain) against those of \"Cousin Willy\" (Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany), close kinship notwithstanding. By 1914, Britain, Russia and Germany had evolved as nation states, with modern governments, beyond the control of princely dynasticism as a political or diplomatic force.Prince Philip's marriage to Princess Elizabeth in 1947 thus represented one of the last iterations of this Queen Victoria's dream. It reunited two of her descendants: Elizabeth through her father's line, and Philip through the line of his mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, a great-granddaughter of Victoria. Indeed, in the previous decade, three of Philip's four sisters had married other descendants of Victoria.But in 1947, times had changed and postwar Britain was not so keen to see the heir to the throne married to a foreign royal. Particularly not one whose sisters had married prominent German officers and whose family had an extremely fragile position on its throne in Greece, with a dynastic history full of abdications, military coups and plebiscites. Prince Philip was therefore \"rebranded\" before his marriage as Philip Mountbatten, lieutenant in the Royal Navy, naturalised British subject. But where did the name Mountbatten come from? And why before he changed his name was he called \"Prince of Greece and Denmark\"?AdvertisementIt is an important question for understanding the identity of the Duke of Edinburgh \u2014 and by extension, the identity of the British royal family and even Britain's position within the wider European Community of nations. It is all very intertwined. Philip himself said\u00a0 in an interview in 2014:His experience is a perfect expression of the extraordinary cosmopolitan environment of the royal courts of Europe a century ago, when royal princes in Prussia and Russia almost always had English nannies, and adults conversed in polished French. Queen Elizabeth II is the product of this same nursery environment and also has very good French.But why would a Greek prince consider himself Scandinavian? In the mid-19th century, when the crumbling Ottoman Empire was giving birth to newly independent states such as Bulgaria and Greece, the Great Powers of Europe determined that it was in the best interests of stability in the region to select junior members of the major royal dynasties to found new monarchies.Greece, independent since 1832, had first been governed by a Bavarian prince, Otto, but in 1863, he was deposed and the 17-year-old Prince William of Denmark chosen instead.AdvertisementDenmark's ruling family, the House of Oldenburg, one of the oldest in Europe, was known for its liberal views, and it was hoped that a young prince from such a family would help the Greeks establish a democratic monarchy along the lines of Denmark, or its closely related ally, England.The reign of Prince William, as King George I of Greece, was long and fairly calm. His son, Constantine I, was another matter, and after a disastrous war with Turkey (1919-1922) he was forced to abdicate. His younger brother, Prince Andrew, had fought in the war, and was sent into exile, along with his infant son, Prince Philip.Philip was thus raised as an exile, first in Paris, then in England, where he boarded at Cheam School in Hampshire. He began a career in the British navy in 1939, served with distinction during WWII, then retired from active service once his wife became the Queen in 1952. He had been naturalized as a British subject in the summer of 1947, a few months before his wedding, and assumed a version of his mother's name, Battenberg \u2014 itself anglicized to Mountbatten at the height of anti-German sentiment in England in 1917.The Battenbergs were also from an ancient ruling family, the House of Hesse, territorial princes in the heart of Germany since the 13th century. Philip wasn't alone in representing the Greek royal family in Britain: a decade before, his cousin Princess Marina had married the youngest son of George V, the Duke of Kent, and had charmed the nation with her elegance and cosmopolitan style.Philip was firmly tied to the UK through his uncle, Earl Mountbatten, a British naval hero during the war \u2014 but, at the same time, he remained closely linked to the old continental system. One of his aunts, Mountbatten's sister, was Queen Louise of Sweden.Louise Mountbatten died in 1965, and Marina of Greece in 1968 and, by the 1970s, royal marriages were seen as affairs of the heart, not affairs of state \u2014 or indeed as points of reunion and reconnection for these ancient royal dynasties.With the passing of the Duke of Edinburgh, one of the last representatives of a system that had endured for a millennium passes into history.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

It is located in the British Museum. ", "Two by two: This Currier & Ives illustration depicts the animals pairing up to enter Noah's Ark, as stated in Genesis 7."], "date": "Oct 15, 2020", "content": "In November 1872, a self-taught historian named George Smith toiled away in the archives of the British Museum sorting through fragments of clay tablets recovered from ancient Mesopotamian archeological sites in modern-day Iraq. The tablets were written in cuneiform \u2014 a language that had only recently been recovered and translated after 1,000 years of obscurity \u2014 and most of the fragments contained humdrum accounting records or opaque prophecies from palace priests.But then Smith found something remarkable. As he translated the cuneiform word by word, a familiar story unfolded. There was a god punishing humanity with a catastrophic flood, one man who was chosen to survive using a specially constructed boat filled with animals and seeds, and after the flood, birds being released to find dry land.This wasn't the story of Noah and the ark, though, and this wasn't the book of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible (known to Christians as the Old Testament). What Smith had discovered was only one chapter in a sprawling Mesopotamian tale now known as the Epic of Gilgamesh, first written in 1,800 B.C.E., around 1,000 years before the Hebrew Bible.\"The Epic of Gilgamesh is the oldest tragic epic for which we have evidence,\" says Louise Pryke, an honorary research associate at the University of Sydney and author of \"Gilgamesh,\" a deep analysis of the text and its influences on later works, from the Bible to Homer's \"Odyssey.\" \"It's something that's come to represent ancient Mesopotamia in modern culture.\"When Smith first made the connection between the two flood stories in Gilgamesh and Genesis, legend says that he became so excited that he danced around the room removing his clothes. Smith's discovery shook the foundations of biblical scholarship by proposing that some, if not all, of the Hebrew Bible was borrowed from neighboring civilizations.Pryke says that while the flood narrative in Genesis is clearly inspired by the tale in Gilgamesh, the similarities and differences in the ancient accounts can teach us important things about what these two cultures valued and their cosmic worldviews.\"These are cultures that are in dialogue with one another and their stories are in dialogue with one another,\" says Pryke.AdvertisementThe Epic of Gilgamesh chronicles the adventures of the semi-divine King Gilgamesh (circa 2700 B.C.E.) as he leaves his home city of Uruk to battle mythical beasts and obtain the secret to eternal life. Not only is this text one of the earliest examples of a hero's quest, it's the first to feature a \"bromance\" in the partnership of Gilgamesh and his best friend Enkidu, who sadly dies midway through the story.The flood narrative forms the heart of Tablet XI, when Gilgamesh seeks out the only survivors of the great deluge, Utanapishtim and his wife, whom the gods granted with immortality. As Utanapishtim tells it, the chief god, Enlil, was tired of humans keeping him awake with all their noise, so he decided to destroy them (or at least \"diminish\" them) with a terrible flood.Enlil forces the gods to make a pact not to tell any humans about the impending inundation, but Ea, the god of wisdom, figures out a clever workaround. He loudly tells a reed wall about Enlil's plan, knowing that Utanapishtim is behind the wall and will overhear everything. Utanapishtim follows Ea's instructions to build a boat of specific dimensions, load it with riches, seeds and animals of every kind, and seal it against the coming storm.When the torrential rains halt after six days and seven nights, Utanapishtim sends out three birds in succession \u2014 a dove, a sparrow and a raven \u2014 to find dry land. When the raven doesn't return, Utanapishtim and his family offer sacrifices to the gods, who are near starvation without any people to feed them.While the oldest partial fragments of Gilgamesh date back to nearly 2000 B.C.E., Pryke says that the best-known Babylonian version was likely penned by Sin-leqi-unninni, an exorcist priest who lived around 1100 B.C.E. The earliest parts of the Hebrew Bible, including much of Genesis, were written around 950 B.C.E.AdvertisementComparing the flood narrative in Gilgamesh to the biblical flood in Genesis \"is an area of scholarship that has attracted more attention than pretty much anything else in the history of Assyriology,\" says Pryke. What's even more incredible about Smith's discovery is that more than a century later, the flood is still the strongest connection between the two texts.Here are the elements of the flood story that Gilgamesh and the Hebrew Bible share, says Pryke:While the similarities have drawn most of the scholarly attention, Pryke says there's as much to learn from where the accounts differ and what that tells us about the cultures in which each tale was told. Some of those differences include:AdvertisementPerhaps the biggest difference between the flood narratives in Gilgamesh and Genesis is the moral of the two stories. In both traditions, a divine power decides to kill off humanity, but in each tale, mankind survives for different reasons. Noah is preserved because he is the most morally clean and obedient. Utanapishtim, on the other hand, is saved quite literally by wisdom, by obtaining divine knowledge.Pryke says that while the Hebrew version of the flood story hinges on morality \u2014 the destruction of the wicked and the saving of the righteous \u2014 the authors of Genesis display a \"wary engagement with wisdom\" elsewhere. Think of the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Eden; Adam and Eve are punished for eating its fruit and trying to obtain divine wisdom (and become like God).In Gilgamesh, the flood story is meant to be instructive for young King Gilgamesh in order to learn his place in the cosmic order.\"As king, Gilgamesh has to mediate between humanity and the gods,\" says Pryke. \"And if that mediation breaks down, things can become quite apocalyptic.\"AdvertisementAll signs point to yes, that the authors of Genesis were clearly aware of the divine deluge described in the earlier Epic of Gilgamesh.\"We actually have the smoking gun,\" says Pryke. \"Archeologists have found bits of the Epic of Gilgamesh all over [Ancient Israel]. It looks like Gilgamesh was something that was in broad circulation at the time.\"Since both the Bible and Gilgamesh were passed along as oral traditions long before they were written down, it's possible that the Mesopotamian flood narrative first entered Hebrew culture as a type of \"contest literature\" similar to 1001 Arabian Nights.\"People traveled somewhere and they'd compete to tell the most remarkable stories that they knew from their culture,\" says Pryke, \"and then you got this cultural discourse that was happening.\"AdvertisementWhile the flood story is the greatest example of Mesopotamian influence on Hebrew culture, there are some other crossovers.Found among the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls, for example, is the apocryphal book of 1 Enoch that includes the \"Book of Giants,\" an account of the supersized beings who walked the Earth before the flood. One of those giants, not coincidentally, is named Gilgamesh, and another shares the name of a monster that Gilgamesh destroyed in his epic tale.There's also a remarkable similarity between some sagely advice first given in Gilgamesh and later in the book of Ecclesiastes in the Hebrew Bible. Here's the text from Gilgamesh:And here it is in Ecclesiastes 9:7-9:However, the similarity in these texts may simply mean that these were common sayings of the time. \"It would be precipitous to surmise that the similarities between these two passages necessarily result from cultural contact or any direct contact between the texts. Good advice seems to have a certain timeless quality, particularly when it is expressed in broad terms that may be applicable to a range of situations and periods,\" Pyrke wrote on the website The Bible and Interpretation.AdvertisementIrving Finkel is a modern-day heir to George Smith. Finkel also works at the British Museum and in 1985 discovered yet another ancient flood narrative written in cuneiform on a fragment of tablet recovered in Iraq. This account, believed to be even older than Gilgamesh, features a Noah-like character named Atrahasis whom the gods command to build a circular boat in preparation for a devastating deluge.So, the natural question is, does the existence of multiple ancient flood narratives amount to proof of a real flood that came close to wiping out all of humanity? Finkel told the London Telegraph that it's very possible there was a massive flood that struck the Tigris and Euphrates Valley between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago and persisted in the collective Mesopotamian memory. Pryke agrees that \"it's a reasonable thing to assume that there was [a flood].\"Pryke says that there's a passage in the Epic of Gilgamesh that may have been inspired by another major environmental disaster. \"Toward the middle of the narrative, he cuts down the forest of the cedars in Lebanon and destroys it. This seems to be a reference to the historical deforestation of that area that happened 1,000 years before Gilgamesh was written down.\""},

But it does seem like a weird nickname for a metropolis that's not particularly known for its orchards. So where did that nickname come from?New York City hasn't always been called the Big Apple. (For that matter, it hasn't always been New York City either. What's up, New Amsterdam?) But it does seem like a weird nickname for a metropolis that's not particularly known for its orchards. So where did that nickname come from?AdvertisementIn the 1920s, there was a reporter for the New York Morning Telegraph who covered horse racing, named John Fitz Gerald (sometimes spelled FitzGerald), as Barry Popik, Gerald Cohen and others have since noted. While there were several famous tracks in New York City, some of the best race horses came from the New Orleans area. Fitz Gerald heard stable hands referring to the races in New York, and their prestige and prize money, as the big apple of horse racing. Fitz Gerald found the term apt and started using it regularly in his columns on racing.AdvertisementThe term Big Apple took off outside of horse racing circles, with jazz musicians \u2013 especially those in Harlem \u2013 calling the city by the nickname. It had the same meaning for musicians as it had for horse racers: There were a lot of small-time racetracks and jazz clubs all over America that might be the small apples, but the fame and fortune to be found in New York was the big apple.In the 1930s, there was a club in Harlem and a dance called \"The Big Apple\" that was performed in a group. In this YouTube clip from 1937, The Big Apple dance looks both exhausting and extremely fun to do:AdvertisementBy the 1950s, the nickname had mostly petered out. And by the 1970s, few people were calling New York City anything but rotten. Crime was high, and people were broke. It was hardly a shiny, bright apple calling to people outside the city to come visit and take a bite.So the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, under the lead of Charles Gillett, started an ad campaign to revitalize the city's reputation as the Big Apple. Gillett was a jazz fan, and he associated the name with that promise of glamour. The campaign worked, and the city has embraced the nickname ever since.John Fitz Gerald lived at the corner of Broadway and West 54th Street in Manhattan for three decades. It's near where \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" is filmed today. If you plug that address into Google Maps and use street view, you can see the sign for Big Apple Corner that was posted in Fitz Gerald's honor in 1997."},

"], "date": "Oct 2, 2019", "content": "Owls are birds of prey that hunt at night. We hardly ever see them because when the hawks and falcons of the world clock out, the owls clock in. On silent, fluffy-edged stealth wings, they hunt small, nocturnal animals while it's dark, occasionally hooting or screaming at each other through the night. Then, when the sun shows up again, they repair to their favorite roost and let the other raptors go about their business eating day creatures.And yet! We humans \u2014 notorious day-dwellers \u2014 pay a lot of attention to these night birds.\"Owls are probably one of the most widely recognized groups of animals in the world,\" says Denver Holt, the founder and lead researcher of the Owl Research Institute based in Charlo, Montana. \"They're in all cultures \u2014 no matter how far back you go, there's always art or myths or stories about owls. They're on our corporate logos, sports logos, products use them to advertise, they're on castle walls and churches. I have a Greek coin that dates back to 400 B.C.E. with an owl on it.\"Even the Chauvet cave in France, which includes Pleistocene art dating back around 30,000 years, contains an etching of an owl.So, what is it about owls? They're not super conspicuous birds \u2014 just like moles aren't super conspicuous rodents \u2014 but you don't see us going around smearing a mole's face all over Tootsie Pop wrappers and Trip Advisor billboards.Well, they are pretty cool. Although they're birds of prey, they're more closely related to mousebirds and kingfishers than eagles, hawks or falcons. However, they also fill the exact ecological niche as these other hunting birds \u2014 they just evolved to be terrifying night killers instead of terrifying day killers (which is, arguably, more unsettling, no?).Owls are masters of camouflage \u2014 even though they share an ecological niche with other raptors, the day shift sees owls as a food source just as much as a rabbit or squirrel. They use their feathers to help them blend in with their surroundings and hide from predators. AdvertisementAnother aspect of an owl's mystique is in their eyes: They have to be large in order to see in the dark, and at this point in their evolution, a significant portion of what's inside an owl's skull is straight up eyeball. In fact, their eyes are cylindrical \u2014 they extend all the way to the back of their head, and you can even see a portion of their eyeballs through their ear holes. And because their eyes aren't sphericals like most eyeballs, they can't roll around in their heads, which means an owl's round head has to do most of the rolling around work. It is for this reason that they can swivel their heads entirely around on their necks.AdvertisementAnother thing owls have to be able to do at night is hear. While other birds of prey do a great job of using sunlight to locate their prey, or at least the telltale rustling of undergrowth associated with it, an owl's night vision can only get them so far. So they require their auditory sense to get them where they need to be while hunting, which is where their big, round faces and lopsided ears come in. While the feathers on the top of some owl species' heads look like ears, they actually serve a function more akin to eyebrows. Their ears are actually large openings on the sides of their heads \u2014 one ear lower than the other, which helps them triangulate sound (a noise goes in one ear a little before it arrives in the other) to better tell which direction it's coming from. To make their sense of hearing even keener, an owl's entire face acts as a sort of satellite dish for sound waves. Their beaks are tiny to keep out of the way, and the circular depressions around their huge eyes boost their ability to snag the sound of a mouse scurrying beneath the snow, like a catcher's mitt.AdvertisementSo, piecing the evidence together \u2014 nocturnal, winged killing machines with incredible night-seeing powers and a preternatural sense of hearing \u2014 you can see why they have inspired so many myths and superstitions. And these stories are a mixed bag, though many of them were unflattering. One ancient Greek and Roman superstition indicated that owls were witches in disguise and would suck the blood right out of your baby. But the same cultures also believed owls to be connected to Athena, the powerful and influential goddess of wisdom and warfare (her ancient Sumerian precursor was Lilith, a horned, taloned goddess surrounded by owls, depicted in a 4,300-year-old Sumerian tablet). While Asian cultures largely considered owls to be good, protective spirits in disguise, most other cultures around the world considered owls to be the bringers of witchcraft, illness and death.But why owls, which ordinarily stay out of our way and even manage our rodent pest population?\"If we have strong feelings about owls, maybe it's because they look like us,\" says Holt. \"They've got a large head, a flat face, big eyes, a symmetry about their mouth and nose. We tend to be attracted \u2014 and repelled by \u2014 animals that are morphologically similar to us.\"While some owls hoot, others, like the barn owl can make the most horrific shriek-hiss (it's horror movie stuff), and a screech owl sounds a bit like a very lonely and distressed dog."},

John McCain. Like McCain, Kelly is a former Navy pilot.But Kelly has exceeded his Arizonian senatorial predecessors by many times in altitude. He and his twin brother, retired NASA astronaut Scott Kelly who spent a record 340 consecutive days in space, took part in NASA's landmark DNA \"Twin Study\" to help understand how the human body adapts to long stays in space. And Mark Kelly's not the first astronaut to land into the upper chamber on Capitol Hill.There have been four others whose careers have taken them from space to senate (or senate to space). Each has a fascinating history. Let's take a look at their paths and how they got there.AdvertisementOther than Neil Armstrong, the first human to walk on the moon, John Glenn is arguably the most famous name in NASA history. Some might find this ironic, considering, he flew into space just once, orbiting Earth just three times on a flight that lasted less than five hours in 1962. This flight made Glenn a national hero, however, because it made him the first American to orbit Earth at all.Glenn remained part of NASA for five years after his famous orbital flight, despite being the oldest astronaut in the corps. He was elected to the Senate in 1974 and represented Ohio for 25 years as a Democrat. He served as chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, and as a member of the Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees. Glenn was considered one of the Senate's leading experts on technical and scientific matters.During his last term as a senator, Glenn served on the Special Committee on Aging. Apropos to this work \u2014 and that biological changes from longtime exposure to spaceflight mimic biological changes associated with aging \u2014 Glenn was selected to return to space on a nine-day mission on the space shuttle Discovery in 1998. At the age of 77, he was the oldest person to travel in space.AdvertisementBefore joining NASA, Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt worked for the U.S. Geological Survey's Astrogeology Center at Flagstaff, Arizona, as project chief for lunar field geological methods. He participated in photo and telescopic mapping of the moon, and trained NASA astronauts on their geological field trips. But in 1965, NASA selected him to be a scientist-astronaut.Schmitt piloted the Apollo 17 mission \u2014 the last manned Apollo mission the U.S. flew to the moon, Dec. 6, 1972. Apollo 17 turned out to be the most scientifically productive lunar mission. Although the Apollo lunar program ended with Schmitt's return to Earth Dec. 19, 1972, he remained with NASA until 1975, studying the lunar samples he and other Apollo astronauts collected.In 1974, Schmitt was appointed NASA assistant administrator for energy programs, a position he held until August 1975, when he resigned to run for Senate in his home state of New Mexico. He was elected Nov. 2, 1976. He served from 1977 to 1983, and sat on the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee; the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee; and the Select Committee on Ethics. He was the ranking Republican member of the Ethics Committee; the Science, Technology and Space Subcommittee of Commerce; and the Consumer Subcommittee of Banking. To this day, Schmitt is the only natural scientist to serve in the U.S. Senate since Thomas Jefferson presided over it.AdvertisementThe next U.S. senator got his spaceflight experience in a very different way than our first two. He technically went from the Senate to space. Edwin \"Jake\" Garn represented the state of Utah as a Republican in the Senate from January 1975 until January 1993. During his tenure, he served as chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, and on several subcommittees: Housing and Urban Affairs; Financial Institutions; and International Finance and Monetary Policy. He also was a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and four Appropriations subcommittees, including Energy and Water Resources; Defense; Military Construction; and Interior.But it was Garn's experience as a naval pilot that made him an obvious choice to work as a payload specialist on the space shuttle Discovery mission in 1985 as part of NASA's program to send civilians into space. Garn had already been a pilot in the United States navy from 1956 to 1960, and flew supply missions to Vietnam with the Utah Air National Guard. By the time he retired as a full colonel in April 1979, he'd flown more than 10,000 hours in military and private civilian aircraft. Garn is the only pilot in aviation history to have wings from the Navy, Air Force and NASA and is the first member of Congress to fly in space.AdvertisementOur last senator, William \"Bill\" Nelson, also flew aboard a space shuttle in January 1986 as part of the same NASA civilian program. Nelson's mission lasted one week on the shuttle Columbia where he also worked as a payload specialist, becoming the second member of Congress \u2014 and first member of the House \u2014 to fly into space. At the time he was a 44-year-old Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives serving Florida.Before that, Nelson was in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1965 to 1971, where he served in Vietnam from 1968 to 1970, earning the rank of captain. Afterward, he returned to Florida and in 1970 began working as a legislative assistant to Gov. Reubin Askew. In 1972, Nelson was elected to the Florida House of Representatives. By 1978 he was elected to represent Florida as a Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives where he served six terms for Florida's 9th and 11th congressional districts. He was elected to U.S. Senate in 2000 and retired in 2019. During his tenure he served on multiple committees, including the Committee on Aging; the Committee on Armed Services; the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation; and the Committee on Finance.Just days after Nelson returned to Earth on his Columbia mission, the Challenger shuttle launched Jan. 28, 1986. This mission also carried a civilian \u2014 schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe \u2014 along with six other crewmembers. But early in the launch phase the vehicle exploded, killing all seven aboard. The disaster ended NASA's program of sending civilians into space."},

Kiger", "image": "https://resize.hswstatic.com/w_828/gif/sun-rotate.jpg", "image_content": ["The sun does indeed rotate, and its rotation isn't difficult to measure, because the thin solar surface has features such as sunspots and prominences, some of which last long enough to be observed. "], "date": "Jan 11, 2019", "content": "Back in the 1600s, astronomer Galileo Galilei peered into his telescope and discovered dark spots on the sun, subsequently noticing that they seemed to move, vanish and then return. \"It is also manifest that their rotation is about the sun,\" he wrote in 1613, and though he noted that it was possible that the sunspots were moving while the sun stayed motionless, \"to me it seems more probable that the movement is of the solar globe than of its surroundings.\"Galileo had discovered that the sun \u2014 like numerous other celestial objects \u2014 rotates on an axis. But aside from the length of time, the manner in which the sun rotates is different than that of a rocky planet such as Earth. Moreover, that difference actually causes the sunspots that originally led to Galileo's discovery.AdvertisementThe sun has been rotating for a long, long time \u2014 it started around the time that it formed from a whirling cloud of dust and hydrogen gas about 4.6 billion years ago. \"Pretty much everything in the universe rotates,\" explains Claire Raftery, head of education and outreach for the National Solar Observatory, the U.S. center for ground-based solar physics, which is located on the campus of the University of Colorado, Boulder. \"Everything is moving relative to everything else.\"As the sun gradually gathered mass and developed the gravity that attracted more and more nearby molecules to it, it also developed angular momentum.The sun's rotation isn't difficult to measure, because the photosphere, the thin solar surface, has features such as sunspots and prominences, some of which are sufficiently long-lasting that they can be observed as they move around, just as Galileo observed them.But from there, it gets a little complicated. The mostly gaseous sun \"is not a solid body, so it doesn't rotate as a single solid ball,\" Raftery says. \"Instead, the gas rotates more rapidly at the equator than at the poles.\"A spot at the equator goes around in about 24 days, while the polar regions take six days longer, according to this article on solar rotation on NASA's website.While the sun rotates differently than Earth does, its differential rotation is similar to the planet Jupiter and other gas giants, Raftery says.Differential rotation actually is what drives the solar cycle, the 11-year period during which the number of sunspots increases for about half of the time, and then decreases. The reason, explains Raftery, is that the sun's magnetic field, which is generated just below the surface, basically gets wrapped around itself by the uneven motion. The result is development of high-density magnetic bands that eventually burst through the surface, causing the eruptions that we see as sunspots and flares.The convection zone, which extends beneath the photosphere for about 125,000 miles (200,000 kilometers), rotates at roughly the same speed from the inner shell to the surface, Raftery says. But deeper inside the sun, scientists aren't sure whether other parts move at a different rate.\"We have some good ideas about this, but it's still an active question,\" Raftery says.Will the sun keep spinning forever? Eventually, about 5 billion years from now, the sun will burn out and eventually collapse into a compact white dwarf star. But even then, Raftery thinks it will continue to rotate, though at a different speed.Since scientists can't peer inside the sun, they instead study how it sounds. How they do this is kind of mind-boggling. The National Solar Observatory uses imagery collected by its Global Oscillation Network Group, an array of telescopes and other instruments at six different locations around the world, and uses sophisticated mathematics to discern solar vibrations. \"The inside of the sun acts almost like a bell,\" Raftery explains. \"There are sound waves bouncing around inside.\""},

What method should you rely upon to get your spacecraft to its destination? Our early efforts in space all depended upon chemical rocket fuel. This fuel is dense in energy, but it also takes up space and is heavy and expensive. Worst of all, once your spacecraft runs out of fuel you're pretty much stuck.We've been exploring alternatives to chemical rockets for several years, and one of the more promising options is the solar sail. Here on Earth, we use sails to capture the wind and transfer momentum to ships. In space, solar sails would capture photons, the basic particles of light.AdvertisementPhotons can deliver a very soft push. That makes it sound like they'd be terrible for spacefaring. But when billions of photons continue to deliver these gentle pushes against the reflective material of the solar sail, that starts to add up.\u00a0What's more, photons are obviously traveling at the speed of light. That means even when the spacecraft has accelerated to incredible speeds, it still is receiving energy from colliding photons. At least, it will until it is out of range of the closest star.In the video, we mentioned a Kickstarter project to fund a solar sail experiment that would for the first time use solar sails for propulsion (an earlier experiment successfully tested the deployment mechanism for solar sails). That project had a $200,000 goal and was promoted by Bill Nye, the CEO of The Planetary Society. Not only did the project meet its goal, supporters contributed a total of $1,241,615 to the effort. That means we should see the LightSail project unfurl its solar sail in 2016.Meanwhile, other teams also are testing solar sails. In October 2015, NASA announced that it would use solar sail technology in an asteroid flyby mission in 2018, with the added goal of making the technology commercially available. This would allow other organizations in the space industry to take advantage of solar sail propulsion.Will solar sails ever be used to transport humans? It's possible, though other methods such as ion propulsion are also likely. Ultimately, solar sail technology may become the effective, relatively inexpensive way we transport cargo in space."},

Some animals use size to their advantage, while others rely on speed or the ability to make a threatening sound. Researchers have recently discovered that even the fairly innocent looking bat has a trick that can be used to thwart the hunting attempts of rival bats.Bats are nocturnal, hunting mainly in the darkness of night. They eat prey that's tiny and quiet, like moths and other insects, which can be difficult to find in low light and darkness. Although the expression \"blind as a bat\" is widely used, bats aren't blind; they just use a much more reliable means of locating these tiny tidbits of dinner than sight.AdvertisementWhen it's time to find food, bats emit a series of high-pitched sounds into the darkness that bounce back when they hit an object. When a bat hears the echoing sound, it knows an object is nearby, and it flies closer to the source of the echo to send out more signals. As the echo-back sound of the increases in intensity, the bat knows it's getting closer to the prey, and he continues emitting signals until he swoops in for the kill. That process of finding a target's location by listening to sonar echoes is called echolocation.While primarily using sonar to find food, bats can also use their sonar in a hostile and competitive way, according to research from 2014. Wake Forest University researcher William Conner and University of Maryland colleague Aaron Corcoran used audio and video systems to observe the behavior of Mexican free-tailed bats as they hunted for tiger moths, a favorite snack. They found that the bats emitted a specific sound that was successful in interfering with the sonar of other prey-seeking bats of the same species. They called this process sweep jamming. The study concluded that bats emit this sound intentionally to interfere with the sonar of food-seeking companions [source: Yong].When the researchers played back recordings of the jamming sound to other bats in search of insects, those bats were also thrown off track; the sound made the bats 86 percent more likely to miss their prey target. The scientists experimented with other sounds like white noise, but those didn't interfere with the bats' sonar [source: Corcoran].In the natural world, sonar and echolocation aren't exclusive to bats -- mammals such as dolphins and other whales also use it to find their way [source: Lewis]. And humans, too, have adapted technology to mimic this process; ships regularly use sonar to help them navigate in dark waters and to explore what's in the water under and around them. Sonar can indicate the presence of another ship, a dangerous obstacle or aquatic life. In warfare, sonar can be lifesaving, clueing a ship in about the presence of a hostile submarine or an enemy torpedo, or jamming the sonar of other ships (just like bats) [source: National Ocean Service].There's no evidence yet that other animals that use echolocation for hunting use a signal-jamming sound. But bats seem to have perfected the process of jamming one another's signals \u2013 all in the search for a better meal."},

These side effects can affect any part of the body, from the skin to the central nervous system. Your eyes are no exception \u2212 plenty of antibiotics can have vision-related side effects. Most are temporary (redness, itchiness, dryness), but some can permanently damage your vision.The U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) issues boxed warnings for the drugs that have severe potential side effects, the ones that doctors have to consider very carefully before prescribing. They should be used only when the potential benefits of the drug outweigh the risk of the side effects \u2212 in other words, as a last resort. When it comes to serious vision-related side effects, the class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones gets a lot of boxed warnings.AdvertisementThere are nine fluoroquinolones available on the U.S. market, one of which (Levaquin) was the top-selling antibiotic in 2010 [source: Brody]. Other common fluoroquinolones subcategories include ciprofloxacin (otherwise known by the brand-names Cipro, Zoxan and Proquin), levofloxacine (Levaquin, Cravit) and moxifloxacin (Avelox). You might have a question at this point in the proceedings: If drugs with boxed warnings are supposed to be used with caution, why are fluoroquinolones the most popular antibiotics in the country? The answer is a common one in the world of antibiotics: overprescription. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged doctors to stop prescribing fluoroquinolone except in the direst cases, saying that overprescription has greatly increased antibiotic resistance and the occurrence of these severe vision-related side effects.Retinal detachment is the most common visual side effect of fluoroquinolones. It's still rare, but one study found that people who took fluoroquinolones had a five times greater risk of developing it [source: Etminan]. Retinal detachment is reversible with surgery but can cause permanent vision loss if it isn't caught quickly. There's also a risk of retinal hemorrhage, which can also irreversibly damage sight in severe cases if not treated immediately.It's not quite clear why fluoroquinolones can be so destructive to the eyes. They clearly cause damage to the collagen and connective tissue inside the eye, but researchers aren't sure exactly how. The threat of these complications increases with age, and they're associated with the oral and injected forms of the drug, not the topical medications.A few other antibiotic classes have been known to cause minor eye reactions. Penicillins (namely amoxicillin and ampicillin) and tetracyclines are sometimes linked to redness, itchiness and dryness. Ethambutol and isoniazid, two tuberculosis medications, can trigger optic nerve issues that cause blurriness and problems with seeing colors. Most of these reactions are temporary and disappear after discontinuation of the antibiotic."},

This could lead to the development of superbugs, or bacteria that are dangerous and resistant to treatments.The researchers presenting this new information found that pairing the maple syrup extract with antibiotics improved the antimicrobial effect of medicine. The extract was so effective at lending a hand that the researchers could use up to 90-percent less antibiotic in a test and get results similar to a full dose.It seems as though the maple syrup component makes bacterial cells more permeable, allowing antibiotics to pass through the bacteria's cell walls easily. Honestly, who could blame the bacteria? Maple syrup is delicious. You'll never see me turn it down.We aren't sure if this will mark the extent to which the sweet syrup can be put to medicinal uses.

Roses are red, and planets are spherical. That's just the way things are, right? After all, building model solar systems would be way more challenging if, instead of using little foam balls, we had to make a bunch of icosahedron-shaped planet models.But have you ever wondered why the planets look like this? Why are they basically spherical and not, say, cylindrical or cube-shaped?AdvertisementWe should kick off this discussion by calling a spade a spade. None of the planets in our solar system are perfect spheres, nor for that matter is our sun. All those bodies could more accurately be described as \"oblate spheroids.\" Objects with this shape bulge slightly around the middle. To borrow an analogy from the astronomer Phil Plait, they look like a basketball that someone is sitting on.Put more technically, in a celestial body with an oblate spheroid shape, the polar circumference will be smaller than the equatorial one. So here on Earth, if you were to travel from the North Pole to the South Pole and back, you'd have walked a grand total of 24,812 miles (39,931 kilometers). On the other hand, a complete trip around the equator would be a bit longer. That's because the circumference of Earth's equator is 24,900 miles (40,070 kilometers). As such, when you stand at sea level on the equator, you're farther away from the center of our planet than you would be at either pole.On some other planets, this bulge is even more pronounced. Just look at Jupiter. Earth is only 0.3 percent wider at the equator than it is from pole to pole. But Jupiter's measurements showcase a much bigger disparity. Indeed, astronomers have found that this plus-sized planet is a full 7 percent wider at its equator than it is between the poles.The oblate spheroid shape is the result of two main factors: gravity and rotation. Troy Carpenter, director of Washington State's Goldendale Observatory, recently discussed the matter with us in an email exchange. \"Everything which has mass experiences gravity, and gravity attempts to crush an object inward in all directions,\" Carpenter explains.That's because all objects experience self-gravity, a force which pulls their atoms toward a common center. As the mass of an object increases, so too does its self-gravitational pull. After it exceeds a certain mass, the pull gets overpowering to the point where the object collapses onto itself and becomes spherical. Little items \u2014 like, say, a banana or a lug wrench \u2014 can resist this fate because their self-gravity is relatively weak, allowing them to retain non-spheroid shapes. However, in planets, suns and other truly massive bodies, the force is so strong that they can't avoid being distorted into spheroids.\"But gravity is not the whole story,\" says Carpenter. While gravity conspires to render the planets spherical, the speed of their rotations is simultaneously trying to flatten them. The faster a celestial body spins, the more disproportionate its equatorial bulge gets. \"This is why there are no perfect spheres in our solar system ... only oblate spheroids,\" Carpenter tells us. \"The sun is almost a perfect sphere, due to its immense gravity and relatively slow rotation rate of 25 days. A significant percentage of stars in the sky rotate much faster and bulge noticeably at their equators.\"One such star is Altair. Located just 16.8 light-years away from our home planet, it's among the brightest objects in the night sky. Altair is also notable for spinning very, very rapidly and completes a full rotation on its axis every 10.4 earth hours. Accordingly, astronomers estimate that Altair is at least 14 percent wider at the equator than it is from pole to pole. Rotational speed also explains Jupiter's bulge. After all, a day on this gas giant is a brisk 9.9 earth hours long.Other forces act upon the stars and planets as well, altering their shapes. Although Earth is an oblate spheroid, it certainly isn't a perfect one. The gravitational pull of the sun and moon both influence the planet's shape to a degree. For that matter, so do Earth's own plate tectonics. Consequently, the mass of our home world isn't evenly distributed \u2014 in fact, it's rather lumpy.Still, it looks a good deal rounder than Jupiter (and Saturn). In turn, the planets in our universe appear way more spherical than some of their moons do. Mars, for instance, has two small satellites, neither of which has the self-gravity to be pulled into an oblate spheroid. Instead, their appearance is often described as potato-shaped.In conclusion, we'll say this much for our home planet: It may not be flawless, but at least the place is fairly well-rounded.In DC comics' Superman franchise, the notorious Bizarro character hails from a celestial body called Htrae. Also known as the Bizarro World (go figure), the planet is shaped like a gigantic cube. According to physics professor and comic book fan James Kakalios, a place like Htrae would have to be teeny-tiny in real life. \"[The] average distance from the center of the Bizarro planet to one of its faces can be no longer than 300 miles (483 kilometers), if it is to avoid deforming into a sphere,\" Kakalios writes in his book \"The Physics of Superheroes.\" By comparison, the state of Texas is over 770 miles (1,239 kilometers) long from east to west. At that puny size, Htrae wouldn't have enough gravitational pull to maintain its own atmosphere."},

The case remains open.AdvertisementNo killer in history is better known than the one who stalked the filthy streets of London in 1888, murdering at least five prostitutes in brutal fashion, terrorizing the city, and sparking an interest in serial killers that has lasted for centuries.

It's 31 years and there's a ton of threads ...\"I think the major pull in doing this was to bring everything all together, get a real good look at the case file, so to speak. And that was tough.\"AdvertisementIn the first hours of March 18, 1990, two men dressed as Boston police officers were buzzed into a side door of the museum, a building that The New York Times described as \"an evocative, almost magical place where generations of Bostonians have gone to admire art, seek a moment of solace or take a date to kindle romance.\" The thieves immediately subdued the two security guards on duty, hustling them into the basement and duct-taping their hands and feet. For the next 81 minutes, the robbers roamed the museum freely.The bad guys cut Rembrandt's \"Christ in the Storm on the Sea of Galilee\" \u2014 Rembrandt's only painted seascape \u2014 and \"A Lady and Gentleman in Black\" from their frames. They lifted the Vermeer \u2014 \"The Concert\" \u2014 and other pieces out of their frames, and took even more works off walls and pedestals.The thieves didn't get past the motion sensors, which were activated and later provided a virtual map of their footsteps. But at the time, the alarms weren't connected to any outside source. So at 2:45 a.m., after two trips to their getaway vehicle, the criminals softly slipped away. The guards were discovered, unharmed and still bound, when cleaning crews arrived later that morning.Almost immediately recognized as the largest art heist ever, the robbery instantly was big news throughout the world. But by later that year, as leads disintegrated and investigations by the police and the FBI foundered, the Gardner Museum theft faded from the front pages of newspapers and out of the public consciousness.Yet the mystery, and its two biggest questions, remain: Who did it? And, more importantly, where is the artwork?AdvertisementThe Barnicle brothers began thinking about the project in 2013, and started in on producing it a year later. In its finished form, \"This is a Robbery: The World's Biggest Art Heist\" is a roughly four-hour series. (The brothers say a \"Barnicle Cut\" might last for days.) It showcases many of the story's more outrageous characters.There's the stoner security guard who allowed the thieves into the museum and was suspected, early on, of being part of an inside job. There's the notorious art thief, Myles Connor, who also was briefly considered a suspect and who helped the brothers shed light on a grimy world of crime bosses and their muscle.There are mobsters (names like Whitey Bulger, Bobby Donati, Bobby Guarente and Carmello Merlino are all tossed out); dogged reporters and amateur sleuths; the respected curator of the museum, Ann Hawley; FBI agents, police, lawyers. All of them figure, in one way or another, in an intricate tale that rests largely on the premise that the artwork was stolen by members of a Boston organized crime syndicate.The belief: Jailed wiseguys can use priceless art to barter for their freedom, a kind of \"Get Out of Jail Free\" masterpiece for mobsters.Some of the suspects in the crime are now dead. Some have been cleared of suspicion. Some we may not even know about yet.But at this point, despite all the digging by law enforcement, local newspapers, several authors (including Stephen Kurkjian in \"Master Thieves: The Boston Gangsters Who Pulled Off the World's Greatest Art Heist\"), and the Barnicles themselves, the case couldn't be colder. You have to wonder now if we'll ever know who pulled off this heist or if we'll ever see the artwork again.Nick Barnicle wonders, too. But after all these years, he's keeping the faith.\"The power of Netflix's platform is incredible, just the reach. To have the story go out globally, I don't think that's a small thing in terms of potentially solving the mystery,\" says Nick, who served as one of the executive producers of the film. \"This is the first really big documentary on it to reach a large audience.\"I think that [Boston reporter] Shelley Murphy says it best [in the film]: It may just be [solved with] an innocuous, 'Hey, grandpa's dead, look what we found,' next-generation type of thing.\"Does that mean he envisions a happy ending to the greatest art heist ever?\"I wouldn't be so shocked to see one or two of the pieces [still] in the New England area. Are all 13 together? Probably not. Are all 13 coming back? Probably not,\" Nick says. \"But we'd like to see one come back.\"AdvertisementIsabella Stewart Gardner was born into a rich New York family, settled in Boston and traveled the world. The museum that bears her name, in the Fens area of Boston (about a mile south of what is now Fenway Park), was filled with her personal collections and curated by her for much of her life. It opened to the public in 1903. Gardner's will provides an endowment for the museum, and states that nothing there ever should be changed, and no artwork added or sold."},

Commonly known as \"turbo mode,\" \"crazy racing,\" and especially \"the zoomies\" all over the internet, this kind of running and playing activity is a necessary way for your dog to release energy. And, while it's more common in puppies and young dogs, even oldsters will get in on the action when a puppy's around.AdvertisementVeterinarians call these outbursts Frenetic Random Activity Periods, or FRAPs for short. While they are part-and-parcel of dog life, FRAPs can cause some consternation for people. One of the best ways to help a dog is by building FRAP time into their daily schedule. Go to a dog park or plan some play time in a fenced backyard. Play time off-leash, if possible, gives your dog room to roam, but if it must stay tethered, add some speed to the walk by jogging or riding a bicycle alongside the dog.You can also learn to watch for pre-zoomie behavior. Often, a dog will leap up, and bow with its front legs down and tail furiously waggling as an invitation to play. Conversely, you can mimic this bow as a signal for the zoomie fun to begin. The idea is not to eliminate your dog's ability to release energy, but to channel it.If the zoomies happen indoors, you can either let the outburst run its course or teach a puppy that indoor zoomies aren't really your thing. When the FRAP starts, put the dog in a crate for a 1- to 2-minute timeout. You can also put light pressure on a dog's shoulder blades as a calming technique \u2014keep your hands firmly but gently in place as the dog sinks calmly to the floor.Keep in mind that playing along or chasing your dog during a zoomie, especially one that's taking place in your home, might lead to some unwelcome events, like broken lamps or scratched wood floors. And certain breeds may be more susceptible to zoomies, like high-energy terriers or greyhounds that love to run.Most FRAP behavior will run its course as your dog matures, so in the meantime, enjoy the show!A dog's Frenetic Random Activity Periods, or FRAPs, are more likely to occur in the morning or evening or after bathing, for reasons no one quite understands \u2014 except maybe the dog, that is.\u00a0"},

But what if getting sick meant we got to experience the joy of visiting Disney World? Suddenly, being sick doesn't mean the same thing. Why, being sick is a delight!Perhaps a tangent, because what we're talking about isn't necessarily a free trip to the Mouse House if you get appendicitis. But recently researchers did find that riding a roller coaster actually resulted in the passage of kidney stones, so imagining a \"Theme Park Treatment\" may be just around the corner. Or up an extremely steep hill followed by a sudden drop, as the case may be. \u00a0AdvertisementResearchers initiated the study after patients reported to their doctors that after a few rides on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in Disney World, their kidney stones had passed. Interesting anecdotal evidence, for sure, but how to test it? Instead of putting people on a roller coaster and expectantly watching them pee after, they decided it would be more effective to use a 3-D model of a kidney with multiple kidney stones, or renal calculi. (That would help, for instance, study how the various positions of a stone might affect the efficacy.) The fun-loving scientists took the model on 20 rides.While they were interested in stone position, what they didn't plan for was seating position on the coaster. Just like everyone else, the 3-D model didn't get to choose its seat. Sometimes it was in front. Sometimes in the back. And that, it turns out, made a huge difference in the experiment. Regardless of size or position of the stone, it passed a whopping 64 percent of the time if the model was in the rear of the coaster. In the front of the coaster, it passed just 17 percent of the time.Since it's just a preliminary study \u2014 albeit a super fun one \u2014 the researchers can't say exactly why this it happens. But in the meantime, they do point out that it could be a viable option to try, since many otherwise healthy Americans live near a roller coaster or two.\u00a0"},

He then kills more people at a similar business.Six of the eight people he killed are Asian women, leading many people to call for him to be charged under the new state hate crime law. Authorities resist, saying they aren't sure that racial bias motivated the man's crimes.That's the situation unfolding in the Atlanta area in Georgia, right now. But there is often a gap between public opinion and law enforcement when people believe a hate crime has been committed, whether against LGBTQ people, racial minorities or Jewish people.Hate crimes and hate murders are rising across the U.S., but long term polling data suggests that most Americans are horrified by bias-motivated violence. They also support hate crime legislation, an effort to deter such attacks.Yet officials often resist the quick classification of incidents as a hate crime. Hate crimes have precise qualities, which must be met to satisfy legal requirements. And even when police and prosecutors believe the elements of a hate crime are present, such crimes can be difficult to prove in court.AdvertisementI have studied hate crime and police for over 20 years.Hate crimes are crimes motivated by bias on the basis of race, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity. In some states, gender, age and gender identity are also included. Hate crime laws have been passed by 47 states and the federal government since the 1980s, when activists first began to press state legislatures to recognize the role of bias in violence against minority groups. Today, only Arkansas, South Carolina and Wyoming do not have hate crime laws.In order to be charged as a hate crime, attacks \u2014 whether assault, killings or vandalism \u2014 must be directed at individuals because of the prohibited biases. Hate crimes, in other words, punish motive; the prosecutor must convince the judge or jury that the victim was targeted because of their race, religion, sexual orientation or other protected characteristic.If the defendant is found to have acted with bias motivation, hate crimes often add an additional penalty to the underlying charge. Charging people with a hate crime, then, presents additional layers of complexity to what may otherwise be a straightforward case for prosecutors. Bias motivation can be hard to prove, and prosecutors can be reluctant to take cases that they may not win in court.It can and does happen, though. In June 2020, Shepard Hoehn placed a burning cross and a sign with racial slurs and epithets facing the construction site where his new neighbor, who is Black, was building a house.Hoehn was charged with and later pleaded guilty to federal hate crime charges in Indiana. A few months later, Maurice Diggins was convicted by a federal jury of a 2018 hate crime for breaking the jaw of a Sudanese man in Maine while shouting racial epithets.AdvertisementThe first use of the term \"hate crime\" in federal legislation was the Hate Crimes Statistics Act of 1990. This was not a criminal statute but rather a data-gathering requirement that mandated that the U.S. attorney general collect data on crimes that \"evidenced prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.\"Soon, states began passing their own laws recognizing bias crimes. But hate crime legislation has not led to as many charges and convictions as activists may have hoped.Law enforcement struggle to identify hate crime and prosecute the offenders. Even though 47 states have hate crime laws, 86.1 percent of law enforcement agencies reported to the FBI that not a single hate crime had occurred in their jurisdiction in 2019, according to the latest FBI data collected.In many cases, police have received inadequate training in making hate crime classification.\"What weights do you give to race, dope, territory? These things are 90 percent gray \u2014 there are no black-and-white incidents,\" said\u00a0 one 20-year veteran police officer in a 1996 study of hate crime.But I've also found that police departments are rarely organized in a way that allows them to develop the expertise necessary to effectively investigate hate crimes. When police departments have specialized police units and prosecutors who are committed to taking on hate crime, they can develop the routines that allow them to investigate hate crime in a manner that supports victims.In the late 1990s I studied a specialized police hate crime unit in a city I called, for the purposes of anonymity, \"Center City.\" My study revealed that those detectives could distinguish non-hate crimes \u2014 for instance, when the perpetrator angrily used the N-word in a fight \u2014 from cases that are truly hate crimes, as when the perpetrator used it during a targeted attack on a Black person.Without the right training and organizational structure, officers are unclear about common markers of bias motivation, and tend to assume that they must go to extraordinary lengths to figure out why suspects committed the crime.\"We don't have time to psychoanalyze people,\" said the same veteran police officer in 1996.Even law enforcement officers specifically trained in bias crime identification still may not name incidents as hate crime that, to the general public, seem obviously bias-driven. This may be the result of police bias.AdvertisementAdvocates for hate crime victims maintain that police and prosecutors can do much more to identify and punish hate crimes.Empirical evidence supports their claims. The FBI's 2019 report contains 8,559 bias crimes reported by law enforcement agencies. But in the National Crime Victimization Survey, victims say that they experienced, on average, more than 200,000 hate crimes each year. This suggests that police are missing many hate crimes that have occurred.Distrust of police, especially in Black communities, may dissuade minorities from even calling the police when they are victimized by hate crime for fear they could also become victims of police violence.All this means that perpetrators of hate crimes may not be caught and can reoffend, further victimizing communities that are meant to be protected by hate crime laws.Hate crime laws reflect American ideals of fairness, justice and equity. But if crimes motivated by bias aren't reported, well investigated, charged or brought to trial, it matters little what state law says.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Manslaughter, with its legally dense and often confusing definitions, isn't murder. True self-defense, considered a legal homicide, isn't murder, either.But all murder, by definition, is homicide.As to those differences between murder and manslaughter \u2014 misogynistic nomenclature aside \u2014 that's a whole 'nother legal quagmire.AdvertisementThe legal definition of murder varies from state to state. Here's the federal definition, from the U.S. Code:The whole idea of \"malice aforethought\" \u2014 which encompasses an intention to kill \u2014 has been reconsidered and refined by courts and legal scholars over the years. Currently, murder is most often broken down into categories: first-degree murder, second-degree, third-degree and so on.All sorts of other terms can get thrown into the mix, words like malice and intent, recklessness and premeditation. Generally \u2014 again, all states are not the same \u2014 this is how it works:First-degree murder usually, but not always, requires a willful act with premeditation, although the definition of premeditation varies, too. It generally means contemplating the act of murder \u2014 planning it in detail or simply thinking about doing it beforehand; intending to do it \u2014 and then carrying it out. Scott Peterson, for instance, was found guilty in 2004 of first-degree murder in the death of his pregnant wife Laci who went missing on Christmas Eve from their home in Modesto, California, in 2002. Scott also was found guilty of second-degree murder in the death of their unborn child. (In October 2020, the California Supreme Court ordered the San Mateo County Superior Court to reexamine Scott's convictions because of a tainted juror pool. A new appeals trial is pending.)Second-degree murder is first-degree murder without the premeditation or intent, but this definition, too, is dependent on where the crime is committed. According to LII, second-degree murder is typically \"caused by the offender's reckless conduct that displays an obvious lack of concern for human life.\" It's often called \"felony murder;\" that is, murder committed in the act of another felony (in many cases, assault).Third-degree murder is recognized in only a few states. One of those states is Minnesota, where former police officer Derek Chauvin faced trial in April 2021 for the 2020 killing of George Floyd. In Minnesota, \"murder in the third degree\" is defined as homicide without intent by acting in a way that is \"eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life.\" It can also be charged for those causing a death in drug-related cases.Chauvin was charged with, and convicted on, three counts: second-degree murder (murder committed while he was assaulting Floyd), third-degree murder (see above), and second-degree manslaughter (see below).Important to note: The sentences for those found guilty on murder charges, generally speaking, are more severe than those for manslaughter. The penalty for those found guilty of first-degree murder is the heaviest of all. A conviction on first-degree murder can, depending on the state (or, in the case of a federal offense), be the death penalty.AdvertisementManslaughter may be considered a less serious crime than murder, with lesser sentences, but it's equally as grim; it still involves homicide.Generally, again \u2014 yes, definitions change with manslaughter, too, depending on where the crime is committed \u2014 manslaughter is murder without intent or \"malice aforethought.\" But it's not that simple.Manslaughter is divided into either intentional (voluntary) or unintentional (involuntary) manslaughter. Voluntary manslaughter, according to LII, is intentionally \"killing another person in the heat of passion and in response to adequate provocation.\" Involuntary manslaughter is \"negligently\" causing the death of another person.So how can someone, then, voluntarily and intentionally kill someone \u2014 something that sounds a heck of a lot like murder \u2014 yet be charged \"only\" with manslaughter?The answer: It's all in the perpetrator's state of mind.Here's how it works in Minnesota, for an example:First-degree manslaughter (or, in Minnesota's books, manslaughter in the first degree) occurs when voluntarily and intentionally causing a death \"in the heat of passion\" when provoked by words or actions that would \"provoke a person of ordinary self-control under like circumstances.\" (A crying child is not provocation in this clause.)Many other actions (or inactions) may prompt a charge of first-degree manslaughter rather than murder. In Minnesota, those include drug-related actions that result in a death, and punishment of a child that results in a death.Second-degree manslaughter \u2014 we're still in Minnesota \u2014 can be charged under several different circumstances. The jury in the Chauvin case found him guilty of second-degree manslaughter because he showed \"culpable negligence\" when he created \"an unreasonable risk, and consciously [took] chances of causing death or great bodily harm to another\" by kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during Floyd's arrest in 2020.Former Brooklyn Center police officer Kimberly Potter also is charged with second-degree manslaughter for killing Daunte Wright. She faces charges after shooting Wright when she says she intended to instead shock him with her Taser.Prosecutors work long and hard before deciding what charges to bring. In the Chauvin case, a judge originally threw out the third-degree murder charge only to reinstate it later. The interpretation of the third-degree murder statute is currently being challenged in another case.Legally speaking, it gets complicated. But in homicide cases, when a person's life and liberty hang in the balance, there may be no other way to ensure that justice is served.Twenty-seven states currently carry a death penalty for first-degree murder, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Capital punishment is OK'd by the military, too, and the federal government. Since 2015, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Colorado and Virginia have abolished the death penalty. Nebraska reinstated it by statewide vote in 2016."},

"], "date": "Jul 21, 2020", "content": "Online learning has been available for decades to K-12 schoolchildren and various levels of post-secondary students. Sometimes called online school, distance learning and more recently, virtual learning, the correct term is \"online learning,\" according to Peter Robertson, president of Laurel Springs School, a leading online K-12 private school, which has offered an online curricula since 1994.Colleges, too, have been big players in the online education game. The University of Phoenix began offering bachelor's and master's courses online in 1989 and by 2003, 40,000 instructors were teaching 150,000 online courses with the Blackboard Learning System. By the fall of 2018, nearly 7 million students were enrolled in some type of distance education course at a degree-granting postsecondary institution, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.Fast-forward to spring 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic hit and schools and universities across the country were forced to switch to online learning \u2014 with varying degrees of success. Many will return to online schooling when they open in the fall, including the Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest in the U.S. The necessary move has prompted questions about online education and whether it can offer the level of experience available from face-to-face classes. Laurel Springs School reported seeing a drastic increase in inquiries since the coronavirus crisis began.Still other districts plan to open their schools with face-to-face learning in the fall, and that has parents nervous and considering online academies as safer alternatives. So what should parents and students look for if they're considering an online learning program?AdvertisementWhen it comes to online education, you have a variety of options from which to choose. Online learning isn't the same as home schooling, although it can take place at home. An online program provides a directed curriculum to students, in one of three general approaches: supplemental, hybrid or fully online.You can also choose between public K-12 online schools (typically free) and private K-12 online schools (typically tuition-based). Within each of these, you can break it down even further. There are online public charter schools and even online schools associated with colleges or universities that provide challenging curricula that allow students to earn college credits while in high school. Stanford Online High School is one example.Like brick-and-mortar schools, not all online schools are created equal. Public schools must follow state guidelines so they may have fewer course options. Some charter schools \u2014 while still free like public school \u2014 may offer broader curricula and more nontraditional teaching methods, writes Christine Sarikas on Prep Scholar. Private schools aren't mandated by the state so they can focus their curricula on things like STEM or religion, though they may or may not be accredited.\"Schools should have well-regarded regional accreditations that offer a true independent, high-quality, third-party assessment of the systems, curriculum and processes within each school they evaluate and monitor,\" Alex Schroeder, M.Ed., dean of faculty at Laurel Springs, says via email.Finding the right online learning program means matching your family's needs, beliefs and budget. Of course, considering your child's learning style is also critical.AdvertisementOnline learning can be beneficial for children in all grades, given they have the proper support, Schroeder says. Younger students need more guidance and support from parents in structuring and accessing their learning throughout the day.\"All students will develop greater skills as independent learners and gain a better understanding of their unique needs and how they can structure their time to optimize their personal learning experience,\" Schroeder says. \"As they get older, students will have gained greater independence as learners as a benefit of their experience online.\"We would not recommend online learning to anyone who does not have the proper home support or anyone who struggles to independently monitor their learning and learning environment.\"Because some students are more independent than others, you should consider whether a synchronous (occurring at the same time) or asynchronous (not at the same time) model will be the best fit for your child. Not all online schools provide both options.Michaela Schieffer, college counselor and scholarship coach with college admissions consulting firm Moon Prep, cautions that parents of online students will naturally need to be more hands-on and serve as de facto guidance counselors. You'll also need to be vigilant and understand that you'll have to create more structure at home.Even if you put in the extra effort to help your students succeed, how will an online academy affect your child's chances of getting into college?AdvertisementUnder normal circumstances, colleges aren't impressed with online schools, but it's because of social concerns \u2014 not academic ones \u2014 Dr. Rachel Rubin, co-founder, Spark Admissions, says. She notes that students of online learning often face an uphill climb as colleges worry about social and emotional development and lack of leadership opportunities.However, Rubin says that in situations where schools were forced to go virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic, students shouldn't expect to be at a disadvantage compared to students whose in-person education continued. It's not yet clear, however, whether college admissions departments will view students differently who attended schools that aggressively continued remote learning and offered letter grades versus schools that minimized curriculum and switched to pass/fail grading systems.Even if you're super-concerned about your children falling behind during the pandemic, Rubin says she does not recommend changing schools \u2014 or choosing a private online school \u2014 if the brick-and-mortar school they're already attending is going virtual this fall. One reason is that transferring may affect their credits and education path. Once their school resumes in-person classes, their path could appear unstable if they transfer back.AdvertisementOnline learning programs don't have to be isolated programs, even when using an asynchronous model for instruction. For example, Laurel Springs offers a number of virtual and in-person socialization opportunities for students in all age groups, and students have access to more than 30 academic clubs, virtual field trips, special events and a social network that allows them to connect with peers. The school hosts celebrations and graduation, and it offers service-learning trips abroad. In terms of hands-on coursework, Laurel Springs students can complete virtual labs, kitchen labs or labs that require kits.\"Regardless of the materials required, Laurel Springs always provides a list of necessary course materials with ample time for students to secure the required items,\" explains Leigh Tillman, M.Ed., dean of curriculum.Rubin suggests that any students learning virtually get involved in community service activities, showcase their compassion and desire to help others by undertaking a project or working on a leadership program.\"There are a huge variety of other things students can do to stand out in the application process,\" she says. The point is that colleges will want to know how a student spends their time \u2014 and that also goes for during the COVID-19 crisis. That might even mean taking more classes. Students can take free open courseware through EdX or Coursera, which can then be highlighted on college applications to help develop a student's \"academic narrative.\"\"There are still so many things students can do to stand out during this time,\" says Rubin. \"They really need to think outside the box.\"Schieffer recommends spending time prepping for standardized tests and researching external scholarships, which can be used at any college.\"Turn it into a family event,\" she says. \"Parents need to be vigilant on checking for those big registration dates like standardized testing.\" It's never too early to get started. Even freshman can start building a list of fellowships they plan to apply to later. Parents can get into the virtual action by watching webinars to get a good handle on their student's academic future.Choosing an online school that is accredited is super-important. Schools become accredited only when they meet a certain quality of education. For high schools, accreditation requirements vary by state. Public schools must follow guidelines set by their state governments to be accredited, while requirements for private and charter schools vary widely."},

The defense successfully makes an appeal while the ball is still live, and the umpire calls a temporary fourth out that (usually) replaces the existing third out. This not only affects players' stat blocks; it can also deny the offense one or more runs [source: MLB].To understand why, we must grapple with one of baseball's more baffling aspects: When does a run scored during the third-out play count?If you think that a runner who crosses the plate before the defense makes its third out scores a run, you're not alone, but you're also not necessarily right. Under rule 4.09, the run would not count if, for example, the third out was a force-out -- an out against a runner who has lost the right to occupy a particular base because of the batter becoming a runner -- or if the third out is made against the batter-runner. Similarly, if two runners cross the plate near each other, but the first runner fails to touch either home or a previous base and is tagged out, then the second run won't count, even if he crossed before the tag (again, assuming two outs) [source: MLB].The second example describes an appeal play, the key to triggering a fourth out. As the name suggests, an appeal play combines an appeal -- pointing out a rules violation to an umpire -- and a play -- tagging the base or the runner to make an out [source: MLB].Even if you don't know it by name, chances are you've seen an appeal play -- say, when a runner scoring from second misses third base, or when a scoring runner from third fails to tag up on a caught fly ball. In either case, the fielder could alert the umpire and tag the bag or the runner to get the out. Well, if either of these circumstances happens during a third-out play, the resulting appeal play triggers a fourth out and removes the scoring run, because the runner is considered out at the base where the violation occurred, and therefore never scored [source: MLB].Confused? A few examples ought to clear things up. Or not ..."},

He has called for an increase in the capital gains tax to help pay for his American Families Plan. "], "date": "Apr 29, 2021", "content": "To help pay for his $1.8 trillion American Families Plan to provide benefits such as paid family and medical leave, universal preschool and free community college education, President Joe Biden is looking to raise taxes on the sale of stocks and other assets owned by the nation's wealthiest investors.To help pay for his $1.8 trillion American Families Plan to provide benefits such as paid family and medical leave, universal preschool and free community college education, President Joe Biden is looking to raise taxes on the sale of stocks and other assets owned by the nation's wealthiest investors.Biden proposes nearly doubling the long-term capital gains tax rate for households with more than $1 million in income, from its current 20 percent to 39.6 percent, the same rate that they would pay under his plan on wages earned from working. Biden also would eliminate a critical inheritance-related tax loophole that allows a lot of capital gains to go untaxed (more on this later). Biden economic adviser Brian Deese explained in an April 26 White House press briefing that the tax hike will affect only the richest Americans, amounting to just 0.3 percent of all taxpayers.While supporters of Biden's proposal see the increase as a way to make taxation fairer and get the richest Americans to pay their fair share, Biden's critics in the GOP claim raising the capital gains tax rate for the wealthy would discourage investment and lead to slower economic growth, as the Washington Examiner reports.But if you're like most Americans, whose incomes primarily come from being paid for working at jobs, you may be wondering what all this brouhaha is about, since capital gains account for 1 percent of the total income of the bottom 80 percent of U.S. households, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. So here's a quick primer.AdvertisementAs the Tax Policy Center explains, capital gains are profits from the sale of an asset such as shares of stock, a business, real estate or a work of art.If you buy something and sell it quickly \u2014 in a year or less \u2014 whatever profit you make is treated basically the same as your income from wages and taxed as such. This is called the short-term capital gains rate. If you are in the 37 percent tax bracket, your short-term capital gains will be taxed at 37 percent.But if you hold on to something for more than one year and then sell it, you're taxed at the long-term capital gains rate, which is based upon one of three tax brackets. If you have taxable income of less than $40,000 a year for a single person, for example, you don't pay any capital gains tax. If you earn between $40,000-$441,450, you pay a 15 percent rate. If you're above that, you pay 20 percent.There are a few nuances to that basic formula. For example, capital gains on collectibles such as artwork or rare coins are taxed at a maximum 28 percent rate, as are shares of qualified small business stock.Also, there are exceptions in the law that keep most ordinary people from having to pay capital gains. If you have a qualified retirement plan such as a 401(k), for example, you can sell shares from your account and not pay capital gains. And if you sell your home for more than you paid for it many years ago, you'll be able to exclude the first $250,000 of your gain \u2014 $500,000 for couples \u2013 from capital gains taxes.The starting point for calculating capital gains, known in tax lingo as the basis, is how much you paid for the asset, plus commissions, and in the case of something like real estate, the cost of improvements less depreciation.AdvertisementAfter ratification of the 16th Amendment in 1913 established the federal government's authority to levy income taxes, capital gains were taxed at the same rate as ordinary tax rates. That changed after World War I, when Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1921, which for the first time put a lower tax rate on profits from investments as a way of stimulating economic growth, and differentiated between short-term and long-term assets, as this 2007 Congressional Research Service report details. After that, Congress started experimenting with different formulas for taxing capital gains.\"The main justification for taxing capital gains at a lower rate is to offset any double taxation because corporate income is already subject to the corporate income tax,\" Stephanie Leiser explains in an email. She's a lecturer at the University of Michigan's Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, and a tax policy expert who wrote a piece for The Conversation about capital gains.\"Other reasons include incentivizing investment and entrepreneurship and helping to offset the fact that part of capital gains is just inflation and doesn't reflect real growth in value,\" Leiser says.Tax revenues from capital gains tend to go up or down, based upon how the stock market and the economy are doing. In 2019, they amounted to $193 billion, or about 11 percent of individual income tax revenues, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation.AdvertisementThat's a little complicated. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model's analysis, just raising the capital gains tax rate for wealthy investors wouldn't necessarily generate more money for the federal government. That's because investors and their advisers are pretty good at coming up with strategies for avoiding taxes, such as timing capital gains to come in years when they have offsetting losses.That's why, according to Leiser, the most important part of Biden's proposal is not the rate increase itself, but the elimination of a tax loophole called the basis-step up. Currently, if an investor buys $100,000 in stocks and they triple in value, he or she can pass that portfolio along to heirs, and the \"basis\"\u2014 the original value of the stocks \u2013 is reset to $300,000. If the heirs eventually sell the stock, they're only taxed on however much the stocks increased in value over that $300,000. Nobody ever has to pay taxes on the $200,000 in appreciation that occurred while the original investor held the stocks.\"Most of us earn almost all of our lifetime income from wages/salary, and that's taxed in the year you earn it, \" Leiser explains. \"But with capital gains, if you can hold on to assets until you die, those gains are never subject to income taxes.\"That results in a huge amount of untaxed wealth. A 2015 analysis written for the Federal Reserve estimated that untaxed capital gains amounted to 55 percent of the value of estates worth $100 million or more.\"The basis step-up has allowed tax-free accumulation of intergenerational wealth \u2014 research shows that it's been one of the most important drivers of wealth inequality and the racial wealth gap in this country,\" Leiser explains.Biden would change that, by requiring heirs with incomes of more than $1 million to pay taxes on the entire amount that a stock has grown in value since it originally was acquired by whoever left it to them.According to Penn Wharton's analysis, by eliminating the stepped-up basis loophole, Biden's increase would raise $113 billion over 10 years.How would increasing capital gains taxes affect the economy? An analysis by investment firm UBS notes that in recent financial history, increases in capital gains taxes haven't caused the stock market to slump. After the last increase in 2013, for example, the S&P index rose that year by nearly 30 percent. Other factors such as the overall economic outlook, monetary policy and interest rates have a much more powerful effect on stock prices and rates of return, the firm says.Additionally, according to UBS, a rate increase's effect would be muted because about 75 percent of stocks are in accounts that aren't subject to capital gains, such as retirement accounts, endowments, and accounts held by foreign investors. UBS also notes that due to Congressional pushback in some quarters, it's more likely that the top capital gains tax rate will move to 28 percent, rather than 39 percent.In addition to capital gains taxes, wealthy investors may also have to pay a 3.8 percent surtax on investment income to help finance the Affordable Care Act, as explained in this article from The Balance."},

It's written into the U.S. Constitution. In addition, the number of House seats a state has helps determine the size of its delegation to the Electoral College, increasing or decreasing state residents' power to pick the president.The seven states that each lost one seat in the House as a result of the 2020 census are California, from 53 to 52; Illinois, from 18 to 17; Michigan, from 14 to 13; New York, from 27 to 26; Ohio, from 16 to 15; Pennsylvania, from 18 to 17; and West Virginia, from 3 to 2.The six states that gained one or more seats after the 2020 count are Colorado, from 7 to 8; Florida, from 27 to 28; Montana, from 1 to 2; North Carolina, from 13 to 14; Oregon, from 5 to 6; and Texas, which gained two, from 36 to 38.AdvertisementDuring the census, the U.S. Census bureau counts the number of people who live in each state on census day of the census year \u2014 in this case, April 1, 2020.The bureau also counts all military and U.S. government employees\u00a0and their dependents who live overseas on that day \u2014 and determines which states they claim as their residences when in the U.S.Any military personnel who are only temporarily deployed overseas are not counted where they live, but in the states where the military bases from which they were deployed are located.Those numbers deliver a total number of people who live in each state, for apportionment purposes.AdvertisementWhen determining how many seats a state gets, there are a few constraints.First is that there are 435 seats and 50 states; the District of Columbia participates in the Electoral College, but gets only a nonvoting delegate in Congress.In addition, states cannot get partial seats. Because every state must get at least one seat, the first 50 seats are assigned automatically, one per state.The Constitution does not specify the specific method of apportioning the rest of the congressional seats, but the underlying assumption is best summarized as \"one person, one vote\" \u2014 every person residing in every state should be included, and no person should have more of a voice than any other.After the first 50, the 385 remaining seats are assigned according to a system called the Method of Equal Proportions, first proposed in 1911 by a U.S. Census Bureau statistician named Joseph A. Hill. This method was first used in the apportionment based on the 1940 census, and has been used ever since. It is a statistical and mathematical series of calculations that determines the priority order in which states receive second seats, third seats and additional seats beyond that.In states that have more than one congressional district, additional calculations will be necessary to determine the boundaries of each of those districts. Often that process is left up to state legislators. The data needed for that next step will be available by Sept. 30, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said during a virtual news conference announcing the apportionment results.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Below the statue is a plaque inscribed with the famous opening verse:If you visit the town of Sterling, Massachusetts today, you'll find a small copper statue of a woolly little creature meant to be a replica of the original lamb that followed 9-year-old Mary Sawyer to school in 1815. Below the statue is a plaque inscribed with the famous opening verse:So who exactly was Mary Sawyer and who was this John Roulstone who allegedly wrote the original poem? According to a 60-page book published in 1928 by none other than Henry Ford (more on that later), Mary Sawyer was a typical New England schoolgirl who nursed a starving lamb back to health, winning a lifelong friend.\"I got the lamb warm by wrapping it in an old garment and holding it in my arms beside the fireplace,\" an adult Sawyer recounted in the book. \"In the morning, much to my girlish delight, it could stand; and from that time it improved rapidly. It soon learned to drink milk; and from the time it would walk about, it would follow me anywhere if only I called it.\"Before leaving for school one morning, Sawyer whistled for the lamb and it came faithfully trotting over, at which point her brother Nat suggested, \"Let's take the lamb to school with us.\" She tried to hide the lamb in a basket under her chair, but it was discovered when she stood up to recite a lesson and the fluffy critter started to bleat. Her teacher, Polly Kimball, \"laughed outright,\" which caused Sawyer some embarrassment, so she took the lamb out to a shed until school was out.John Roulstone was a local boy preparing for college who happened to be visiting the old red schoolhouse that day and was \"very much pleased with the incident of the lamb,\" Sawyer recalled in Henry Ford's book. Roulstone went home, wrote a three-stanza poem and returned the next day on horseback to hand deliver the original verses of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" to Sawyer herself.Or so goes the story in Sterling, Massachusetts.AdvertisementMeanwhile, in Newport, New Hampshire, the townsfolk celebrate hometown hero Sarah Josepha Hale, as the author of this beloved nursery rhyme. (Hale is also famous for her role in   creating the Thanksgiving celebration). As a young poet and writer, Hale moved to Boston in 1828 to become the editor of the first women's magazine in the United States, later known as \"Godey's Lady's Book.\" It was in Boston that Hale met Lowell Mason, a young musician and composer intent on bringing music education into America's public schools.Mason and Hale shared the belief that simple children's poems set to music could be used to teach good, Christian morals to kids that would help them grow them into productive and upright citizens. At Mason's request, Hale wrote a short book of 15 poems called \"Poems For Our Children,\" which was published in 1830. Mason then wrote simple melodies to accompany each poem, including the six-verse poem then known as \"Mary's Lamb.\"Interestingly, the tune Mason wrote for Mary's Lamb, which was included in his 1831 book \"Juvenile Lyre,\" likely the first public school songbook, sounds nothing like the melody every schoolkid now knows by heart. That melody was borrowed later from a popular minstrel tune called \"Goodnight Ladies,\" specifically the chorus that goes, \"Merrily we roll along, roll along, roll along. Merrily we roll along, over the dark blue sea!\"Anyway, back to the controversy. Sawyer claimed that the first three verses of Hale's poem were identical to the one written by young John Roulstone, although the piece of paper gifted to Sawyer had long since disappeared. And Roulstone tragically died while a freshman at Harvard, so he wasn't around to corroborate. When Hale's version was included in school readers nationwide in the 1850s, Sawyer assumed that the author had simply expanded on Roulstone's original three verses.But Hale denied ever seeing another version of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" and swore she had conjured the story wholly from her imagination. Both Sawyer and Hale signed letters and sworn statements in their old age (Hale just days before her death in 1889) professing that they were telling the truth of the origin of what had already become a classic nursery rhyme.AdvertisementAfter both of the women were long gone, automobile magnate Henry Ford stepped into the fray. In 1927, he took up the cause of Mary Sawyer, moving the wooden frame of Mary's original red schoolhouse from Sterling. Massachusetts, to the nearby town of Sudbury, where Ford owned an inn. Then in 1928, he published the aforementioned book titled \"The Story of Mary and Her Little Lamb,\" which gives Roulstone full credit for the original verses and asked why a respected local woman who served as a matron of the local hospital would make up such a wild story and repeat it her entire life.Hale's defenders ask the same question. \"The story of Mary Sawyer implies that somehow Sarah Hale came across this never published schoolhouse poem and plagiarized it. How could she have come across it?\" writes Sandra Sonnichsen, volunteer archivist of the Sarah J. Hale Collection at the Richards Free Library in Newport, New Hampshire. \"Henry Ford's book explains that the two towns [where Sawyer and Hale lived] were close to each other. They are ninety miles apart over the most direct route that would have been followed in 1815. Henry had not yet invented the automobile, so the distance was considerable.\"In a hilarious Baltimore Sun story from 1998 about the ongoing feud between Sterling, Massachusetts and Newport, New Hampshire, a Hale supporter and Newport librarian comments, \"Let's face it. Henry Ford made good cars. I don't think he's a good historian.\"In the late 1870s and early 1880s, Thomas Edison and Alexander Graham Bell were separately experimenting with primitive devices to record sound. In each of the men's earliest recordings, they recited \u2014 what else? \u2014 \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\""},

It's not pretty when the straight-talking Midwesterner launches into her from-the-heart harangue on the evils of racial discrimination. It can be uncomfortable, even \u2014 squirm-in-your-seat, stare-at-your-shoes uncomfortable \u2014 when she subjects someone to the very same exercise she first unleashed on third graders more than a half-century ago, designed to expose racist thinking. Some think her method can get downright mean.But, again: The subject is racism. Nothing about it is pretty.\"You think that's traumatizing?\" Elliott says of her in-your-face educational methods, which have been alternately vilified and celebrated through the years. \"Try living that way for a lifetime.\"AdvertisementElliott came to prominence when, the day after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, she took her classroom of all-white third graders in Riceville, Iowa, and decided to teach them what it was like to face discrimination. She separated the kids into two groups \u2014 those with brown eyes and those with blue \u2014 and proceeded to proclaim the brown eyes the \"superior\" group. She allowed the group extra privileges (more time at recess, seats in the front of the room). They were told they were cleaner. Smarter. More talented.How the children reacted to this newfound pecking order was startling. The brown-eyed group immediately began to wield their dominance. The blue-eyeds almost immediately slipped into the role of subordinates. Anger flared. Disputes popped up.After switching roles a few days later, which gave both sides of the classroom a taste of being the \"lesser\" group, the exercise ended. Many parents, after reading about what happened in Elliott's classroom through student essays printed in the local paper, complained. A month or so later, Johnny Carson invited Elliott to appear on his late-night talk show. She became a national story.Many praised her efforts at opening her students' eyes. But not everybody. From a 2005 story in Smithsonian Magazine:Elliott taught for years before she decided to take her anti-racism lesson out of the classroom and into corporate America. She's also led the exercise for the U.S. Department of Education and other governmental groups. She's appeared before numerous church and school assemblies. She often faces uncomfortable, sometimes angry, reactions.She was on Oprah Winfrey's TV show several times. In June 2020, she appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Her goal, as it has been for the past 52 years, is education. It's the best weapon against racism, she says.AdvertisementBut good education about racism and race is hard to find.\"Because the educators believe the same thing that they were taught, and they were taught the same thing that I was, which is that there are three or four different races and you can tell what a man's intelligence is by the color of his skin or the shape of his head,\" says Elliott from her home in Iowa. \"You can't lead people out of ignorance if you're still teaching that Columbus discovered America and we came here to civilize these savages.\"We need to teach the three Rs of Rights, Respect and Responsibility,\" she says, barely taking a breath. \"If teachers would respect the rights of those students to learn the truth, and be held responsible for seeing that they present them with the truth, we could kill racism in two generations. There's not a doubt in my mind that that could be done.\"For all of her life, Elliott, 87, has seen America grapple with racism. She's marked major mileposts in the struggle over the past 50 or so years: the Civil Rights movement and the assassination of King in the '60s. The race riots in Miami's Liberty City in 1980 and in Los Angeles after the Rodney King beating in 1992.Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 (the killing of Michael Brown). Baltimore (Freddy Brown) and Charleston, South Carolina, (a church massacre) in 2015. There are many others.But the problem she has been relentlessly attacking, Elliott says, goes far beyond the occasional race-based flareup. For people of color in the U.S., facing down racism is an everyday fight. Every minute of every day. It's exhausting.\"It's only been going on with me for 52 years,\" Elliott says. \"I know black women who have been doing this for 89 years, and their mothers did and their grandmothers did and their great-grandmothers did. And their daughters and their granddaughters and their great-granddaughters are going to have to do it unless we get off our polyunsaturated fatty acids and do something about this.\"I get paid to talk about it. They aren't even allowed to talk about it.\"AdvertisementOne of the biggest hurdles in educating people about racism in the United States, Elliott says, is that most everyone knows it exists and knows that it's harmful, but few are motivated to change it. She has stood in front of classes and asked who among the white people in the room would want to switch places with a Black person. No one ever volunteers.But in 2020, after a lifetime of trying to teach people that humans are one race, that all human life springs from Africa, and that the separation of humans into races has no biological basis and is used only for various (often nefarious) societal reasons, Elliott sees some small signs of promise, maybe a faint sign of movement.\"I think the killing of George Floyd forced people of the pale-faced variety to recognize that the things that Black people have been describing as happening to them every day were finally real for us. Finally,\" she says. \"It was in their face, and they finally had to admit that they have been denying, or ignoring, or justifying what has happened to Black males all these years.\"But in the next breath, Elliott cautions that recognizing the problem is only the first step. Correcting it still must be done. And with the current racial tensions in the United States, exacerbated (she believes) by the current president, things could get even worse.\"'Those who forget the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them.' And we are repeating. We are repeating,\" she says. \"I'm seeing this happen, I watch the news, and I go downtown, and oh my god, they're replicating the blue eyes, brown eyes exercise in the national sphere. I can't believe it.\"Still, Elliott is nothing if not persistent. She will continue to educate \"for the next 50 years,\" she says. She will push her mantra of \"one race.\" And she says, she will urge people to get out and vote this November in the hope of electing leaders who will attack racism, as she has, head on.\"There'll be hope after the November election,\" she says. \"That's the only hope we have right now.\"The biggest words on Elliott's website are the top headline: One Race. The science behind the simple words is clear. According to the National Human Genome Research Institute, your genome \u2014 the body's blueprint that contains all of your DNA \u2014 is 99.9 percent the same as every human around you."},

Schools offered various types of online learning, but even in the best-case scenarios, students lost out on important learning experiences and socialization opportunities. And parents have continued to juggle child care and work duties throughout the summer months.With cases of coronavirus surging across many states, fear of students returning to the classroom has many school districts returning to virtual classrooms in the fall, including the Los Angeles Unified School District, the second largest in the U.S. And that has many parents worrying of the chaos of spring repeating \u2014 and turning to the concept of \"learning pods\" as alternatives for help with teaching and maintaining some sort of social contact for their kids.But what is a learning pod and could your child benefit from being part of one? Facebook abounds with groups like Pandemic Pods, which started in San Francisco and has nearly 30,000 members, and Georgia-based Cobb County Small Learning Groups with 4,300 members. For families with the ability to set up or join a learning pod, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their children's academic success and life skills may be reduced. But those families without the means could see the the gap in education only widen further.AdvertisementThe idea of learning pods and micro-schools didn't arise in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, though the concept has gained popularity because of it. Maureen O'Shaughnessy, Ed.D. published the book \"Creating Micro-Schools for Colorful Mismatched Kids\" in 2019. She's also founder of the Micro-School Coalition, and believes micro-schools and learning pods should be unique and \"reflect the values of the community that they serve.\" Rather than acting as a specific model, the coalition serves only as an example of how to feature small classrooms with multi-age students; and innovative teaching models with personalized learning and holistic curriculums.Parents starting learning pods during the pandemic are mimicking this concept \u2014 meaning there are many different models for learning pods across the country. Some parents are going as far as hiring private teachers or tutors and forgoing the online curriculums offered by their children's schools.Others, like Gwen Baer, a mother of three from Decatur, Georgia, have put together parent-facilitated pods. Baer works as a physician assistant in a COVID-19 clinic, and her family has teamed up with two other families. They will have their children meet in a learning pod for two hours a day, four days a week. Each parent will serve as the facilitator once a week and they will use their county's online curriculum to teach the children.This learning pod is comprised of older children \u2014 a mix of fifth through ninth graders \u2014 and Baer says the model might not work as well with younger students because the pod entails independent learning.\"We're going to be relying heavily on the school to teach our children,\" she says. For example, if a math question comes up, the parent facilitator will assist the students in emailing their teacher, not teaching them the math.They're lucky, too, because none of the families has to provide their home as the learning space. They'll have full use of a carriage house being provided by a relative, so the only expected costs the families will incur are for the internet and a deep cleaning of the carriage house every two weeks.Baer recognizes that considering the widespread coronavirus community transmission in Georgia, forming the pod lies outside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for social distancing.\"However, we are working parents, so we did need to find some sort of child care solution for our families,\" she says. \"Hence the pod solution felt like a pretty good balance.\"Baer and the other parents reviewed the return-to-school plans of some private schools that will offer face-to-face instruction when they set up their space.\"I'm feeling pretty good about it,\" Baer says. \"[We're] going into it with the idea that we are going to have to have a great deal of flexibility. If we have to pivot, we have to pivot.\"AdvertisementWorking with other students and being engaged in some form of group work \u2014 known as cooperative learning \u2014 increases knowledge and develops important skills like communication, teamwork and empathy, says Dori Wolfson, Ed.M., founder of Boston-based Sundial Learning Consultants. Wolfson is a 30-year education veteran in the public, private and nonprofit sectors.Decatur, Georgia, mom Tammie Willis looked for a cooperative way to boost online learning and socialization during the pandemic. Her son is a rising eighth grader and didn't struggle with the online learning format. However, because he is an only child, Willis had concerns about his loneliness.\"What he really missed with the online learning was the day-to-day social interaction that he gets with the other students,\" Willis says. In April, she started looking for solutions for the fall semester after she determined he would not attend in-person classes even if the school resumed face-to-face instruction, which so far, the district has not.Willis found a few like-minded families who had similar social distancing practices and formed what she refers to as a \"co-op.\" The parents started meeting during the summer to work out the kinks. Their co-op will offer students a safe space to socialize; most of the meetings will take place outdoors. Rather than directly supporting the online assignments from the school, the co-op will count on parents to lead sessions and teach skillsets related to the eighth-grade curriculum. AdvertisementLearning pods and micro-schools offer a valuable option for the families who can afford them both financially and in parent effort and involvement. However, there are concerns that this model \"will benefit economically advantaged families and will leave less-affluent families worse off, further widening the socioeconomic divide in the U.S.,\" Rebekah Bastian wrote for Forbes. The funding situation for schools could worsen, too, especially if more students are pulled out of public school to opt for the private-teacher home-school version of learning pods, according to a New York Times article.The necessary shift to online learning has exposed the inequitable landscape of education already present and growing before the pandemic, Wolfson says.\"Just like in pre-COVID times, lower-resourced schools have had to stretch the most during COVID to support our country's most vulnerable students,\" she explains. \"Adding to food, housing and health care insecurity increases during this time, learning insecurity\u00a0without schools in session further widens the gap between available resources \u2014 namely the community created by the trusted adult in the role of teacher \u2014 and the school-age children in need.\"This is what policy and decision makers should pour their focus and energy into: How to create fair and equitable learning and support during the times of online schooling and pandemic education.\"Without outside support, online learning works best when parents are home, according to Debra West, a recently retired educator in Huntsville, Alabama, and founder of Best Education Possible.\"You really have to be there to supervise,\" she says and compares learning at home to being in a classroom where a teacher is constantly rotating around the room. Parents who have to work outside the home need more support. West saw this during the spring 2020 virtual learning when parents of her former students contacted her.\"They were really, really struggling and having a hard time,\" West says. In response, she created a course to help parents get started on the right foot.\"The main thing I'm trying to get across is that they have to start off correctly, and they have to start off with a routine,\" West explains. Go to bed, get up, get dressed, have a dedicated workspace, so the child knows where to work.\"You can't just leave it like it's going to be OK, because it's not,\" she says. \"I just really feel like it's going to take a complete community effort.\"AdvertisementBefore jumping in to join an existing pod or start one from scratch, parents and guardians should define their goals. Be honest with yourself and your pod crew to discover what it is you really need, Wolfson says. Are you looking for all-day coverage, academic support, enhancement of online learning, learning through play, someone to set up a schedule for you or help with curriculum?\"Decide what success is going to look like at the end of the learning time,\" she advises. For pods seeking a teacher, identifying and solidifying what the goals of the pod are first will help you find the right fit.Another consideration is safety. Putting together a pod with families practicing similar social distancing practices is key. \"Families are trying to match up based on their family's particular level of isolation,\" says Baer. \"There is an array of comfort levels.\"Decatur mom of two Jennifer Yeager wants her children to be part of a learning pod this fall, but she has found that families have a variety of goals and ideas about how to structure the group. She and her husband made it through the spring by simultaneously working and assisting their children with schoolwork. They set up a three-family social pod during summer, but the fall learning pod has not come together yet.\"Everybody is doing this differently, and everybody has different risk tolerances,\" she says. \"I'm still hopeful that the fall will be a better experience than the spring. I'm super stressed about trying to figure out the pod.\"A teacher's strike in 1968 closed New York City public schools for more than two months. When students returned to school after the strike ended, about a quarter of all students from second to ninth grade were reading at a level two years below the national norm, and two months below their test scores from the previous year. What affect the pandemic will have on children remains to be seen. "},

Amnesty International said: \"The objective is clear: to raze Alexei Navalny's movement to the ground while he languishes in prison.\" ", "Alexei Navalny, face covered in the green antiseptic zelyonka, after the attack against him in Moscow on April 27, 2017.", "Navalny on Feb. 29, 2020 during a march in memory of politician Boris Nemtsov, a physicist, liberal politician and reformer, who was assassinated on Feb. 27, 2015 in Russia."], "date": "Apr 28, 2021", "content": "Prominent anti-corruption activist, opposition leader and founder of the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK), Alexei Navalny, is a hero to millions of Russians and supporters around the world. But he is a constant irritant to Russian president Vladimir Putin and his United Russia party which Navalny describes as the \"party of crooks and thieves.\"Navalny came to prominence around 13 years ago when he started blogging about corruption at state-owned companies. By 2011, his readership had ballooned, turning him into one of the leaders of anti-Putin demonstrations in Moscow, some of the largest seen in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. The purpose was to gain followers, influence and to finally run for national office himself, which Putin and his party had no intention of allowing to happen.AdvertisementIn 2013, Navalny launched an unsuccessful bid to become mayor of Moscow, a bold move and one that would have positioned him as part of the power structure of the international city. But despite his courageous voice against corruption, Navalny has a complicated political side.He ran on a nationalist platform, calling for highly restrictive (some say racist) immigration policies against Muslims in the Caucasus and Central Asia. He also supported Russia's 2008 war against Georgia. And though that's not why he lost the election, these views came back to haunt him as he saw his support erode with human rights organizations such as Amnesty International. Duke University's Irina Soboleva told VOX.com that Navalny's \"hardline anti-immigration stances alienated members of his young, urban base.\"In 2013 and 2014, Russian officials charged Navalny with embezzlement, accusing him of misappropriating about 16 million rubles ($500,000) worth of lumber from a state-owned company. The move was designed to harass him and drive support away from his anti-corruption campaign. After the second charge, he was placed under house arrest and was officially only allowed to speak to his family. Navalny began a campaign to further expose corruption and weaken Putin and his government. He posted embarrassing videos of Russian officials on his YouTube channel (it currently has 6.5 million subscribers.)A brilliant political strategist, Navalny focused on building his \"brand\" as a corruption-fighter, establishing a robust national network of regional politicians committed to anti-corruption and the defeat of the United Russia party. He also announced his intention to run for president in the coming years (which the government has since refused to allow.) But these actions put a target squarely on Navalny's back.AdvertisementIn 2017, the antiseptic, zelyonka, was thrown in Navalny's face and (according to him) cost 80 percent of his vision in his right eye. Two years later, he was detained by the police and put in jail. While there he suffered a severe skin reaction requiring medical attention at a hospital. He claimed he'd been poisoned and it seemed obvious that harassment from Putin's regime was escalating.In August 2020 Navalny fell ill while on a flight from Siberia to Moscow. The plane diverted, making an emergency landing in Omsk, near Kazakhstan. Navalny fell into a coma before arriving at the hospital. Because of previous attacks and because his wife, Yulia Navalnaya, and other members of his team were barred from the hospital, speculation immediately arose that Navalny had been poisoned. After weeks in the hospital at Omsk, Navalny was stable enough to be transferred to a hospital in Berlin, Germany, to be examined, treated and hopefully to recover.He was released on Sept. 23 and in October, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons found that Navalny had been poisoned with Novichok, a lethal, military-grade nerve agent. Operatives learned that Novichok had liberally been spread on the crotch of Navalny's underwear. Naturally Putin and his cronies denied involvement, but evidence suggested otherwise.AdvertisementNavalny flew back to Russia in January 2021 knowing that the Kremlin had placed him on the federal government's wanted list for \"evading supervision\" (a requirement of his probation in the 2014 embezzlement case) while he was recuperating in Germany from the poisoning. He was immediately arrested at Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo airport, telling reporters at the scene, \"I am not afraid. I know that I am in the right and that all the criminal cases against me are fabricated.\"In early February 2021, Navalny was convicted of violating the terms of his 2014 conviction, and later sentenced to serve his sentence of at least 2.5 years at Penal Colony No. 2, also known as IK2 in the city of Pokrov in the Vladimir Region of Russia, east of Moscow. The prison is known for strict enforcement of rules, \"a colony maximally isolated from the outside world ... in which convicts are 'broken,'\" according to Mediazone.On March 31, Navalny started a hunger strike protesting the lack of appropriate and independent medical care related to ongoing symptoms from the Novichok poisoning. The hunger strike continued for three weeks before his condition worsened to the point that prison officials hospitalized him for treatment, raising speculation that he might be force-fed. This led to outcry from leaders around the world including U.S. President Joe Biden, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders of the G7.Navalny's spokesperson posted on Facebook that \"Alexei is dying ... it's a question of days.\" Physicians close to the dissident stepped in, persuading him to end his hunger strike, which he did on April 23, 2021, releasing a statement on social media:\"Doctors, whom I fully trust, published a statement yesterday stating that you and I had achieved enough for me to end the hunger strike. And I will say frankly \u2014 their words that the tests show that 'in a minimum time there will be no one to treat ...' seem to me worthy of attention.\"Despite mounting international pressure to release Navalny, few expect that to happen. Instead, in a move designed to further silence Navalny and his organization, a Moscow court ruled to shut down the activities of the Anti-Corruption Foundation, pending a decision on whether the organization should be outlawed as an extremist group, even as thousands of demonstrators continue to march in the streets in support of Navalny and opposition to Putin.Alexei Navalny studied law at Moscow's Friendship of the Peoples University, graduating in 1998. He spent a year as a student in the U.S. as a Yale World Fellow in 2010. His colleagues in the Fellowship put out a statement of support on his behalf in August 2020."},

Whether it's rebooting video gaming systems from the '80s and '90s, reviving the corpse of Total Request Live (this time without Carson Daly) or churning out a seemingly endless array of movie remakes, there appears to be no new, good ideas in Hollywood these days. There are only questionable decisions to return to old ideas.If there's a success story in the rush to revival, it's vinyl records. Wax is back in a big way, with record sales nearing $1 billion a year. Now some folks are hoping the cassettes that nearly made vinyl extinct can get in on the action.AdvertisementMusic studios are putting out cassette tapes from artists as varied as Lana Del Rey, Arcade Fire and Rick Ross. They are also re-releasing cassette versions of classic albums by everyone from Bob Marley and Nirvana to Ice Cube. OK, maybe Urban Outfitters doesn't have the same cultural cache that it once did, but the chain's embrace of the tape means the cassettes could have new legs.Cassette sales skyrocketed by 74 percent last year, thanks in part to strong showings from Prince and Eminem reissues combined with new albums from Justin Bieber and The Weeknd. But before you go diving into the closet or under your bed to dig up all those old tapes, keep in mind that listeners bought a total of 129,000 cassettes last year, barely a blip on the radar when compared to the 13.1 million vinyl records (and the 200.8 million albums) sold in 2016. The biggest audio tape seller of last year was \"Guardians of the Galaxy Awesome Mix: Volume 1,\" which sold 4,000 copies. (Cassettes featured heavily in the movie.)But why would anyone want to buy a cassette tape? It's never gotten love from audiophiles the way vinyl has. Nostalgia is one reason. Another? The manager of Anticon Records, Shaun Koplow, says cassettes force you to relax. \"Cassette tapes demand that you're patient. You're not going to be skipping tracks as you would on your phone,\" he told the Wall Street Journal. Plus, how else will you create an honest-to-goodness mixtape?It's safe to say that tapes are not going to dominate the music industry anytime soon. They could, however, cut into vinyl's bottom line. Cassettes are a lot cheaper to make than records.MTV has a new TV show called \"90's House,\" where 12 millennials live in a house filled with only '90s technology. Will they survive without smartphones and social media? Well at least they get to experience cassette recorders and AOL dial-up."},

Everybody knows a Secret Service agent when they see one, right?Ah, but the United States Secret Service is way more than no-nonsense automatons packing heat and putting their lives on the line to protect presidents and other political bigwigs. When the United States Secret Service \u2014 the USSS, for all you government acronym-iacs \u2014 came into being at the end of the Civil War, protecting people wasn't even in its DNA.Here are some tidbits you might not know about one of the most undercover of undercover outfits in the federal government:AdvertisementOnly about 3,600 of the 7,000-plus USSS employees are the stern-looking bodyguards (known as special agents) that protect the president and other select government officials.Some 1,650 Secret Service employees are Uniformed Division officers whose duty is to securely lock down the venues, wherever they might be, where the president and other officials appear. The Uniformed Division is responsible for security at the White House, too, the Naval Observatory (the residence of the vice president), the Treasury Department, and other places like foreign embassies in Washington, D.C.Yet another 2,300 or so provide technical law enforcement and other behind-the-scenes support; things like figuring out the safest routes for motorcades, the best and most secure way to outfit \"The Beast\" (a recent name for the president's main limousine), how to avoid chemical attacks ... and the more mundane governmental work of filing expense reports and answering questions from officers or agents who have trouble signing onto their laptops.Most USSS personnel are not hanging out with the president. It's hardly the stuff of \"Olympus Has Fallen\" or \"White House Down.\"AdvertisementWhen the USSS was formed in 1865, it was a bureau of the Treasury Department. Its mission was to battle widespread counterfeiting; at the end of the Civil War, nearly a third of all currency in circulation in the United States was fake. The Secret Service was there to help stabilize the financial system by ridding the country of counterfeiters.Yeah. Not exactly \"In the Line of Fire,\" either.Still, it's important stuff, and a key pillar in the Secret Service's dual mission, which is protection of the government's top dogs and investigation of crimes regarding the financial system at home and abroad. The people of the agency take both missions very seriously.How important can guarding money really be?According to a USSS spokesperson \u2014 this is straight from an email \u2014 \"Over the past decade, the Secret Service has made approximately 50,000 arrests for counterfeiting, cyber and financial crimes and seized $1.8B in counterfeit currency. The Secret Service has also prevented potential loss of approximately $53B.\"The B, as you may have figured, means \"billions.\" So ... yeah. Important.So does the Secret Service still report to Treasury? No. On March 1, 2003, the USSS was transferred to the newly formed Department of Homeland Security, which now seems a better fit. But the Secret Service is still all over protecting the financial infrastructure of the nation.AdvertisementAs Clint Eastwood, Gerard Butler, Channing Tatum and many other Hollywood types have shown, you can't get past the very American coolness that is part of being a Secret Service special agent. They are the very real people willing to take a bullet to save others' lives.Certainly, it's not all that exciting all the time. \"The best way to sum up being a Secret Service agent,\" former agent Johnathan Wackrow, who spent 14 years with the Service, more than four of them on protective detail of then-President Barack Obama, told Vanity Fair, \"is prolonged periods of boredom only broken up by moments of sheer terror.\"Secret Service agents saved Ronald Reagan in an assassination attempt in 1981. They helped Jackie back into the convertible when John F. Kennedy was shot in 1963. They wrapped up presidential candidate Donald Trump and rushed him off the stage when someone shouted \"gun\" at a rally in 2016. They're there, on Inauguration Day, providing a human shield as the president almost invariably takes a stroll down Pennsylvania Avenue.It's pretty slow, when it's not terrifying. But the pressure, at all times, is outrageous.\"The Secret Service has a zero fail mission,\" Lt. Christopher Fagan told a bunch of Secret Service rookies in a Business Insider video. \"What that means in layman's terms, ladies and gentlemen, is this: You don't get a bad day in the Secret Service.\"If you have a bad day, and you don't do your job, you're going to change the world.\" And he doesn't mean for the better.AdvertisementIt wasn't until the assassination of President William McKinley in 1901 that the Secret Service was tasked with protecting the president.(Quick aside, under \"It's Not Like This Anymore\": McKinley was shot twice in the abdomen by anarchist Leon Czolgosz. The president died eight days later. Czolgosz's trial started nine days after McKinley's death and lasted three days. The murderer was hanged less than two months after the attack.)AdvertisementIt's been reported that only one out of 100 applicants makes it to special agent training, and a lot of them wash out once they get to the James J. Rowley Training Center in Laurel, Maryland.All recruits go through a six-month training program after they're thoroughly vetted. They're given a polygraph. They go through firearms training, driver's training ( where they're taught things like evasive maneuvering), hand-to-hand combat training, your basic federal law enforcement training. Once they make it that far, they spend three to five years in a field office, at home or abroad. And only then, maybe, do they move onto the second phase of the career, in a protective division assignment. The best go on to the Presidential Protective Division (PPD), where most serve a minimum of six years.AdvertisementThat's right... mostly. \"If you have visible body markings, you will be required to medically remove such visible body markings at your own expense prior to entering on duty with the Secret Service,\" the USSS says on its site.When asked about the tattoo taboo, a USSS spokesperson emailed, \"The U.S. Secret Service, similar to other law enforcement agencies, has a uniform standard of dress to which employees are held.\"And that's all there is to that.AdvertisementPrior marijuana use, or even abuse of prescription drugs or over-the-counter drugs, is not an automatic bar to getting into the Secret Service. It depends on how old an applicant is and when s/he last used. It's a pretty woke position for a generally buttoned-down outfit.\"The USSS does not condone any prior unlawful drug activity by Applicants,\" the USSS says on its site, \"but it recognizes that some otherwise qualified Applicants may have used or otherwise interacted with illegal drugs at some point in their past.\"That said, any applicant who currently uses illegal drugs will be found to be \"unsuitable.\"And, yes, there is a drug test.AdvertisementIn 1971, Laurie Anderson, Sue Baker, Kathryn Clark, Holly Hufschmidt and Phyllis Shantz became the first five women special agents. But it wasn't until 2013 that the first female \u2014 Julia A. Pierson \u2014 was appointed to lead the agency. She became the 23rd director of the USSS March 27, 2013.But of the more than 7,000 employees today, fewer than a quarter are women. The Service insists, though, that it's trying.\"Approximately 24 percent of Secret Services employees are women,\" the USSS spokesperson says. \"The Secret Service is continually and actively recruiting to ensure a diverse mix of employees. Part of these efforts include visiting colleges, hosting information sessions, and participating in career fairs.\"After Secret Service special agents spend three years in a field office and six years or more in a protective division, they move onto the final phase of their careers, which can include further protective assignments, further field office work, or a bump into specialty assignments (including things like training new agents, getting into work on electronic crimes, or being assigned to a Congressional staff gig). Entry level special agents start at $49,016 a year. In Phase 3 of their careers, special agents can make nearly $145,000 a year."},

He had ideal size, speed, and quickness, plus the toughness and mental ability to adjust his coverage tactics to rule changes that favored receivers.The 6'3\", 205-pound Georgia native played his college ball at Southern Univer\u00adsity. In 1970, Pittsburgh made Blount (born 1948) a third-round draft choice. Although he excelled on the kickoff return team as a rookie, with a 29.7-yard average, it took him a while to become a top cornerback.AdvertisementBy 1972, he was ready: He didn't allow a single TD pass all season. In 1975, the year the Steelers won their second Super Bowl, Blount was named the NFL's most valuable defender by the Associated Press. That season, he led the NFL (and set the Steeler record) with 11 pass interceptions.The Steelers' defense of the 1970s boasted such stars as Joe Greene, Jack Ham, L. C. Greenwood, and Jack Lambert. Blount more than held his own in that glittering company.He was known for his rugged play, making hard but clean tackles all over the field. His specialty was the \"bump-and-run\" pass defense. He'd stick to a pass receiver, shoving and bumping him down the field. Because of his size and speed, Mel literally overpowered pass catchers.Midway through Mel's career, NFL rulemakers made such harassment of receivers illegal five yards past the line of scrimmage. They could have called it \"The Blount Rule.\" But even after the rule took away his favorite technique, Blount remained one of the league\u2019s best cover men. In 1978 and '79, he helped the Steelers to two more Super Bowl victories.Blount, who played an even 200 games for the Steelers, finished his 14-season career with a Pittsburgh-record 57 interceptions.

Those have belonged most to Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo.In total, Snyder and Capullo will have collaborated on close to 50 issues of the comic, along with the rest of their team, inker Danny Miki and colorist FCO Plascencia.How does a team like this give a fresh look and feel to a character that began in 1939 in the pages of \"Detective Comics,\" the book DC takes its name from? A deep love for the character is a good starting point.Snyder, made famous by his \"American Vampire\" comic for DC's imprint \"Vertigo,\" had been itching for a chance to write Batman near the end of Grant Morrison's run on the character. Back then, Bruce Wayne was thought to be dead, and Batman had been replaced by his former Robin, Dick Grayson.\"I started writing [my first Batman story] 'The Black Mirror' in 2009,\" Snyder tells us. \"It's weird to think how long ago that was. But this was my first regular work on my favorite character, and I was terrified, but it was easy to translate that anxiety into Dick as a character because he was going through that same thing with being Batman.\"It was apparent that Snyder had a passion and love for the character of Batman. \"The Black Mirror\" showed an understanding of the iconography of Batman and his history that enabled it to hit the charts of The New York Times. It was no surprise then, when it was announced that he and superstar artist Greg Capullo would team up to bring these new adventures to readers. Everyone hoped for something special, and something special was delivered.Snyder talks a lot about how nervous he was, putting words and thoughts and feelings in the head of Bruce Wayne: \"We relaunched Batman, and it was Bruce [as Batman,] and he doesn't talk about his feelings, so I had to channel all the characters around him. Now, with \"Superheavy\" [the penultimate story in their arc], putting [Commissioner] Jim [Gordon] in the suit, it's almost going full circle with a new character, because he's older and maybe he doesn't have the right reasons or maybe he does, but it's a rejuvenation thing, and that's what I felt with this arc.\"As a writer, Snyder began his run with Dick Grayson in the suit, and here, so close to the end, someone else has assumed the identity, and he's offered us a fascinating window into what being Batman means to different people. This is something that other writer/artist teams haven't been able to do, and arguably never with as much panache as Snyder and Capullo.But what's next for them? DC Comics hasn't revealed everything yet. The publisher is launching a massive event called \"Rebirth\"\u00a0that puts some of the continuity wiped out by their \"New 52\" reboot back into play. \"Batman\" comics will certainly play a part in this company-wide event (that DC Comics hasn't said much about) and until that's over, answers about what comes next for Snyder and Capullo are unclear.Whether they come back to the character or have moved on for good, they've certainly made a mark that will have long-lasting repercussions for Batman and has defined the character for a generation.Five characters in continuity have taken up the mantle of Robin: Dick Grayson, who went on to become Nightwing, Jason Todd, who was murdered by Joker and brought back to become Red Hood, Tim Drake, who left to make his own way as Red Robin, Stephanie Brown, who began life as The Spoiler, and Damian Wayne, who was Bruce Wayne's son by way of Talia al Ghul."},

Leigh, with her piercing blue eyes, long lashes and sophisticated sex appeal, donned a silver gown and flowing wrap of bold red fabric designed to mimic a Balenciaga cape. In the ad, she positioned her hands near her face to highlight her matching deep red Revlon nail polish and lipstick. The iconic ad's tagline, worthy of Peggy Olson and the \"Mad Men\" crew, read, \"For you who love to flirt with fire ...who dare to skate on thin ice.\" This \"lips and tips\" ad campaign kicked off a long-lasting beauty trend: matching your lipstick to your nail polish.AdvertisementAlthough no longer a fashion must (it fell out of favor a few decades ago) the trend is now hot again. Many beauty companies are releasing lipsticks and nail polishes in the same color. Matching \"lips and tips\" is a fun way to create a bold or ladylike look \u2013 think \"Mad Men\" again. And it takes some of the guesswork out of makeup.But there are other ways to coordinate besides being matchy-matchy. You can match either your nail or lip color to your outfit (like a red lipstick with a red dress and French manicure.) Or, you can coordinate your nail polish to your eye shadow. For example, if you're wearing smoky-colored eye shadow, wear a dark nail polish and downplay your lips by choosing a more neutral lipstick color.How far you coordinate everything depends a lot on how dressed up you are. In jeans, you can wear any color lipstick and nail polish. But, if you're showing off a more polished, evening look, make it a point to coordinate your nail polish and lipstick with your dress.When choosing lipstick and nail polish, always go for colors that work with your skin tone. If you have fair skin, go with nudes, pinks, sheers and pastels. For a more dramatic look, occasionally choose a pop of dark color to contrast your fair skin.If you've got olive skin, choose polishes and lipsticks with gold, orange, red or yellow-based brown hues; avoid tones with blue bases. Berry, chocolate and wine shades will all look great on dark skin.But no matter the style or season, the most important thing is to choose colors that fit your personality. If you're on the conservative side, you may want to stay away from flashy shades. But if your personality is more fire than ice, then by all means go for them!"},

Their nimbleness and temperament aside, are they even healthy enough for adventuring?Far be it from us to question the wisdom of Gandalf the Grey, but what exactly qualifies a hobbit for a lengthy, dangerous trek across Middle Earth? Their nimbleness and temperament aside, are they even healthy enough for adventuring?In his classic adventure tale \"The Hobbit,\" originally published in 1938 and never out of print, J.R.R. Tolkien introduced the diminutive race. He described hobbits as \"a little people, about half our height\" who preserved an \"ancestral habit of living in tunnels and holes.\" They tended to be solitary and portly, which seems reasonable given their penchant for pipe-weed, ale and a staggering six meals per day. Sure, they were accomplished hiders, but little else seemed to qualify halflings for cross-continental travel and frequent monster encounters.Clearly, the wizard Gandalf didn't require Bilbo (or his cousin Frodo, whom he also recruited) to pass a pre-adventuring physical. But if we force our modern understanding of health and biology on the people of the Shire, what can we determine? A few contemporary scientists and researchers have been kind enough to offer their speculative interpretations of hobbit physiology.AdvertisementFor starters, let's consider those six daily meals. Is this the lifestyle of a burrowing glutton, or proper caloric intake for a halfling? In 2015, Krisho Manoharan and Skye Rosetti of the University of Leicester Centre for Interdisciplinary Science weighed in on the issue with their paper \"Modelling the BMR of Species in Middle-Earth.\"Manoharan and Rosetti set out to determine the base metabolic rate (BMR) for the elves and hobbits of Middle Earth \u2014 if those humanoid species were actually real, of course. In other words, they set out to gauge the amount of energy their bodies need to function at rest. They did this by modeling each race as a mammalian Earth species. The European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) stood in for the forest-dwelling elves. The hobbit, being a burrowing, hole-dwelling people, was stuck with the Southwestern pygmy possum (Cercartetus concinnus).The authors concluded that hobbits would have boasted a BMR of 1818.7 kilocalories every day, this compared to 1702.2 kilocalories every six days for humans (or \"men\" in Tolkien's writings) and 1416.5 kilocalories every five days for elves. As such, they figured the average hobbit would require 6.7 meals per day. Indeed, that's in keeping with the higher energy demands of smaller birds and mammals.In a follow-up paper, Manoharan and Rosetti concluded that a single hobbit would require 76 pieces of elven lembas bread to march from Imraldis to Mount Doom, as happens in \"The Lord of the Rings\" trilogy that followed \"The Hobbit.\" That amount compared with 99 for a dwarf, 60 for an elf and 71 for men. As such, the nine members of the fellowship of the ring would require 675 pieces of lembas, with 304 pieces allotted to the four hobbit members.AdvertisementIn Tolkien's \"The Hobbit,\" Bilbo Baggins often complains of fatigue. He also pines for a more robust meal schedule \u2014 as do some of his dwarven traveling companions. Still, he manages to get by on less.\"(Meals) didn't come quite as often as Bilbo would have liked them,\" Tolkien writes, \"but still he began to feel that adventures were not so bad after all.\"When meals did present themselves, however, Bilbo was all in on whatever was offered, be it cream and honey provided by a vegetarian werebear, or mere sorrel and berries scavenged in the mountain wilds. He dreamt of bacon and eggs, but could subsist on seemingly anything \u2014 and this may illustrate another key adventuring advantage for the halfling species: a varied omnivorous diet.AdvertisementAs Dr. Joseph A. Hopkinson and son Nicholas S. Hopkinson argue in their Medical Journal of Australia paper \"The hobbit \u2014 an unexpected deficiency,\" the sort of diet would be a key advantage considering the hobbit's subterranean tendencies. Because to live away from the sun is to cut yourself of from a key source of vitamin D. The so-called \"sunshine\" vitamin is crucial for skeletal health and the immune system, with deficiency symptoms ranging from depression and weakness to increased bone fragility.Fortunately, you can obtain vitamin D from various foods, such as oily fish (which benefits the subterranean, former-hobbit Gollum). Bilbo's diverse diet and willingness to travel long distances in the sun, the Hopkinsons argue, not only boosts his vitamin D intake but also makes the hobbit species one of Middle Earth's top vitamin D consumers.Based on the text of \"The Hobbit,\" the researchers assigned major Middle Earth species and individuals a vitamin D score between zero and four. Hobbits, men and high elves topped the list with fours, dwarves scored a three and Gollum a lowly one. The evil species of Middle Earth (dragons, goblins and trolls) all scored zeros.The Hopkinsons go so far as to argue that vitamin D consumption might serve as a decent predictor of victory in Middle Earth \u2014 alongside moral attributes and martial prowess. (Face it, Sauron, your orc hordes will only get so far with gloomy dispositions and brittle bones.)So perhaps Gandalf indeed saw something special in hobbits: a high-metabolism creature with a varied diet, able to march across Middle Earth's varied ecosystem and eat whatever they could find.Dr. Hopkinson had previously studied the effects of vitamin D in people with lung disease, and is not a fan of all the wizard and hobbit smoking. Reached for comment, he provided some advice for any sunshine-avoidant hobbits out there looking to stay healthy.\"The best and briefest health advice is to eat less and move more,\" Hopkinson tells HowStuffWorks. \"Adventures are one way to achieve this, though maybe not the safest. As Bilbo says, 'Adventures are not all pony-rides in May-sunshine.'\"Dragons aren't real. But if they were, could they actually breath fire? HowStuffWorks investigates in this article."},

You start channel-surfing and come across a show with people slurping a concoction of maggots and hissing beetles for a chance to win 50 grand. On channel after channel you see shows with truckers driving across treacherously icy roads in Alaska, two people telling folks what not to wear, and crab fisherman braving a mother of a storm. Now you're asking yourself, when did Elaine, Jerry, George and Kramer get replaced by Lauren, Heidi, Audrina and Brody? Who in the world are New York and Tila Tequila, and why do they have their own shows? Just when did reality TV get to be so popular? And, finally, how do people come up with this stuff -- and how real are these shows anyway?Reality TV has morphed from radio game show and amateur talent competition to hidden camera stunt show to dating show to documentary-style series. The genre now encompasses unscripted dramas, makeover sagas, celebrity expos\u00e9s, lifestyle-change shows, dating shows, talent extravaganzas and just about any kind of competition you can think of (and a few that you probably can't). In the fall 2007 season, there were more than a dozen reality shows in prime-time slots on major networks and cable channels. On any given night, you can watch \"The Biggest Loser,\" \"Dancing with the Stars,\" \"The Real World,\" \"I Love New York,\" \"Beauty and the Geek,\" \"America's Next Top Model,\" \"Ultimate Fighter,\" \"The Bachelor,\" \"Run's House\" or \"Project Runway\" -- to name just a few.AdvertisementBy definition, reality TV is essentially unscripted programming that doesn't employ actors and focuses on footage of real events or situations. Reality shows also often use a host to run the show or a narrator to tell the story or set the stage of events that are about to unfold. Unlike scripted shows like sitcoms, dramas and newscasts, reality TV does not rely on writers and actors, and much of the show is run by producers and a team of editors. Because of this, it can be a very affordable programming option from a production standpoint -- and it's why networks are scrambling to add reality content in the wake of the Writers Guild of America strike.The defining aspect of reality TV is probably the manner in which it is shot. Whether the show takes place in a real setting with real people (much like a documentary), shoots in front of a live studio audience that participates in the program, or uses hidden surveillance, reality TV relies on the camera capturing everything as it happens. In this article, we'll learn about what constitutes reality TV today, the types of reality programs, when they got to be so popular -- and if they're all as \"real\" as they claim to be. But first, let's take a look at how it all started.A reality show's segment producers or story editors usually assemble storyboards and shooting scripts, important tools for shaping the direction of the show. In the TV sitcom and drama world, these folks would be known as writers. But unlike writers, they're generally not recognized by the Writers Guild of America and so aren't union employees. This distinction could be seen as a disservice to the segment producers and story editors, but it benefits the show in that it lowers production costs -- and it helps preserve the idea that the shows are real and unscripted. It also allows reality shows to keep on rolling when a writers' strike hits, like it did in fall 2007. Many reality show staffers have contested the distinction in ongoing court cases since 2005."},

Luckily, you can combat that feeling by adding one simple step to your skin care regimen -- moisturize.A daily coating of lotion or cream can mean the difference between dull skin and smooth, supple skin. Moisturizers can treat dry skin, protect sensitive skin and even improve tone and texture. In fact, moisturizing year-round can help improve the quality and appearance of your skin. Moreover, the right moisturizer can provide relief to cracked, itchy skin during winter months.AdvertisementMoisturizers often include one or both of two specific types of ingredients: humectants and emollients. Humectants such as alpha hydroxy acids, glycerin and urea work by absorbing water from the air around you and drawing it into your skin. Emollients include ingredients like lanolin, mineral oil or petrolatum, which fill in spaces between skin cells to smooth the appearance and feel of rough, dry skin [source: Mayo Clinic].To find a moisturizer that will be the most beneficial to you, you need to consider your skin type. Use a water-based product if you have normal or oily skin, an oil-based moisturizer for dry or mature skin, and a product free of fragrances and dyes for sensitive skin [source: Mayo Clinic]. Once you find something that works, stick with it. However, if it starts to fall short, don't hesitate to find something new. For example, during the winter months, you might find that your skin is super dry and the lotion you loved all summer just isn't doing the trick. So, for the winter months, you might consider a richer product like a body cream. Just be careful to review the ingredients and continue to consider your skin type. If you have oily skin, that doesn't preclude you from taking advantage of a heavier cream during the winter. Just make sure it's made up of noncomedogenic ingredients (things that won't clog your pores) like avocado oil, almond oil or mineral oil [source: Davis].When it comes to moisturizers, other than selecting products suited to your skin type and avoiding ingredients you're allergic to, there are no fixed rules. You should try a variety of products until you find one that leaves your skin feeling fresh and silky smooth.Finding the right product is only one part of moisturizing.

It's kind of a silly name -- and just in case you think there's a group of grown men who get paid to wander movie sets while clutching dolls, let us set you straight. Dolly grip is probably one of the most physically and mentally demanding film jobs out there.The dolly grip's sole focus is ... wait for it ... the dolly. And what is a dolly, you ask? It's a 500-pound (227-kilogram) wheeled contraption mounted with a camera that slides around on a track, allowing the camera to capture a moving shot. The dolly grip builds the track, mounts the camera and then physically moves the dolly (and the camera operator and assistant sitting on the dolly) during the actual shot. Most dolly shots are so smooth, you probably don't even notice them half the time. This is because the dolly grip is doing a good job.AdvertisementBeing a dolly grip is obviously a very physical job, but it's also incredibly complex. The camera operator and his or her assistant are responsible for the focus, pan and tilt of the camera, but the dolly grip is in charge of all the physical movement. Because that movement could be vastly different for every scene, the dolly grip is constantly securing cameras, building and disassembling the track and moving equipment. The dolly grip, cameraman and assistant have to be a tight team, instantly adapting to each new camera setup.The dolly grip always has to be in exactly the right place at exactly the right time. Everything else could be perfect -- lighting, sound, actors in their places -- but if the dolly slides past its mark, it's all for naught. They say the best dolly grips are the ones who have \"good touch.\" They can react on the fly to unexpected changes and difficult situations, always in the right place at the right time.Even if a scene doesn't call for a dolly, the dolly grip is still on the job, as the safety spotter for the camera operator. Dolly grips can also earn extra money during a shoot if they rent out their own equipment. An experienced dolly grip will usually own about 100 feet (30 meters) of track, tools, ropes, harnesses and plenty of skateboard wheels.All dolly grips learn the ropes as unspecialized grips, and sometimes as production assistants, before working their way into the dolly position. Many dolly grips eventually make the move up to key grip, but a lot of them stay put. Dolly grips can make about $35,000 for a 12-week shoot, about the same pay grade as a best boy (the second-in-command to the key grip) [source: Dzyak]. They usually get tapped for a new job from a best boy they've worked with before, so a good attitude and pleasant demeanor tend to come in handy just as much as \"good touch\" does."},

The Secret Service, oddly enough, is the agency tasked with enforcing U.S. counterfeit laws, but it doesn't publish explicit rules for movie money. And prop companies that cross the agency's blurred line will get an unwelcome visit from the feds.Just ask Gregg Bilson Jr., president and CEO of Independent Studio Services (ISS), one of the biggest prop houses in Hollywood. Back in 2000, ISS got a huge order from the producers of \"Rush Hour 2\" \u2014 $1 billion in fake $100 bills.\"Fourteen pallet loads of $100 bills,\" remembers Bilson. \"Just to buy the paper to make the billion dollars \u2014 and this was 16 years ago \u2014 cost $77,000. And that didn't include the printing, the labor, everything.\"\"Rush Hour 2\" producers brought in a Secret Service agent to give the green light to the film's climactic stunt \u2014 blowing up the billion dollars in cash and having it rain down on the crowded Las Vegas Strip. Halfway through production, the agent informed the producers that the money printed by ISS was too close to the real thing. But the producers ignored the agent and never told Bilson.\"When we filmed the scene, extras grabbed handfuls of the cash to keep as souvenirs,\" says Bilson. \"Then those bills started turning up in different places. That's when the proverbial s&%t hit the fan.\"Bilson received a cease-and-desist order from the Secret Service and had to turn over or destroy all remaining copies of the prop currency. The feds eventually recovered 19 fake bills that passed at cash registers in Las Vegas and Los Angeles and more than $180 million that was stashed as souvenirs. That was the last time ISS printed prop money. Now Bilson encourages productions to use real money instead, which is perfectly legal.\"There's this urban legend out there that you can't photograph real money,\" says Bilson. \"The first thing Secret Service will say is to use real money. Other than having hundreds of thousands or potentially millions of dollars exposed, there's no reason not to use real money.\"ISS now sells stacks of blank bills \u2014 some are even street-aged \u2014 that can be topped with one real one and passed off as millions. But for music videos that call for close-ups of rappers flipping through stacks of hundreds, blanks aren't going to cut it. That's where RJ Rappaport and his Atlanta prop house come in.Rappaport sells two main types of prop cash popular with productions, a two-sided version used for background that's \"100 percent impossible to mistake for real money,\" and a one-sided version designed for close-ups that's dangerously close to the real thing, until you flip it over and it's blank.\"The Secret Service keeps statistics about what counterfeit bills have been used in crimes. Our money has never, ever, ever been used in a crime,\" says Rappaport. \"You would have to be blind. I love Ray Charles, but Ray Charles would be able to tell our money is fake, and not only is Ray Charles blind, but he's dead.\"Rappaport designs the fake bills himself, spending as much as a year tweaking his original drawings \u2014 not copies, he insists \u2014 to meet his clients' demands while staying on the right side of the law. It's not always easy.\"There is no acceptance letter that you get from the FBI, or Secret Service or law enforcement. It doesn't work like that,\" says Rappaport. \"They don't say, 'Yup, that's fine.' But they will say, \u2018We won't go after you. That's acceptable.' That's as much of a handshake and a nod as you're going to get. Very often, though, you won't even get that. It's almost impossible to get a meeting with the Secret Service.\"The Secret Service might not publish official guidelines for prop money, but it does provide a handy chart for identifying counterfeit currency. So heads up to the distracted 16-year-old checkout girl texting her boyfriend at the register: That next $100 bill might be a leftover from a Lil Wayne video.\u00a0According to Fred Reed's \"Show Me the Money,\" a history of money in movies, the very first film to feature legal tender was Thomas Edison's 1895 reel of a cockfight.

"], "date": null, "content": "In 1422, King Charles VI died after ruling France for more than 40 years. Also remembered as Charles the Mad, the king may have been the first person to exhibit the glass delusion; that is, he thought he was made of glass and would break. The delusion, brought on by melancholia, would continue to pop up through medieval Europe until the late 19th century.\u00a0Hippocrates took it upon himself to define melancholia in his tome \"Aphorisms\" as a long-lasting \"fright or despondency.\" Think of it as profound depression. The condition affected those who were isolated and not generally around a lot of people. People with the melancholia-induced-glass delusion also often experienced photophobia, or an extreme sensitivity to light.AdvertisementThe French King Charles VI was so convinced of his glass fragility that he insisted on having special clothes made for him, reinforced with iron on the inside so that he wouldn't shatter with the movement required of his station. He also wouldn't let people touch him, for fear of breaking, something that persisted through his life.Charles VI wasn't the only royalty with the glass delusion. Princess Alexandra Amelie of Bavaria was convinced that she'd swallowed a glass grand piano as a child that had reconstituted her somehow into fragile glass. She, too, took care with her movements to avoid \"breaking.\" (This is the case Stuff You Missed in History Class discuss in their podcast.)According to a 1990 History of Psychiatry paper reviewing this type of melancholy, others afflicted by such delusions thought they were flasks (now called urinals), oil lamps or some other glass receptacle.The combination of photosensitivity and fragility factoring into delusions at this time in history is thought to have been partially due to the invention of clear glass. People had never seen clear glass before, and they viewed it as something almost magical.In that 1990 paper, author Gill Speak writes that melancholiacs whose delusions manifested in a need to protect the body often were preoccupied with protecting the soul, too. The glass delusion may well have been a side effect of dealing with the metaphysical reality of death and self-preservation.These issues haven't disappeared in today's world either. If you're isolated from people and suffering from a mental illness, it sort of makes sense to imagine yourself as a material that's easily breakable and largely invisible.Today, though, delusions often reflect more recent technological or cultural advances. In fact, a 2011 study published in the International Journal of Social Psychiatry found that, since 1950, the most common delusion came in the form of persecution complexes and the belief of being spied on. Since the advent of the Cold War and the evolution of today's technological landscape, it's no wonder that delusion took hold. And if Edward Snowden is even half right, maybe a fear of being spied on isn't that delusional after all.The glass delusion has appeared in many places in popular literature, the most famous being \"El licenciado Vidriera\" (or \"The Glass Graduate\"), a short story by Cervantes. It's about a boy who purchases an aphrodisiac that, instead of having the desired effect, confers on him the glass delusion."},

"], "date": null, "content": "It shook Hollywood and film fans when Lucasfilm announced that co-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were going to be removed from the new \"Star Wars\" stand-alone film starring Alden Ehrenreich as a young Han Solo. A mere 24 hours later, Kathleen Kennedy, the president of Lucasfilm, announced that veteran filmmaker and George Lucas prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ron Howard would step in to finish the film.Here's the thing: It's not the first time this has happened, though some of the outsized reactions to the news might have made it seem like that. So, here at HowStuffWorks, we wanted to bring up five times when similar situations have occurred and we still wound up with arguably great films.AdvertisementFive directors actually had their hands on the classic 1939 film, each getting replaced for different reasons. The first, Norman Taurog, oversaw many of the early tests of the film but was reassigned to another film instead. At that point, Richard Thorpe stepped in. After a few weeks of filming, the studio heads decided that Thorpe didn't understand how to film a fairy tale, and he was fired. Legendary director George Cukor, who was steeped in preproduction for \"Gone With the Wind,\" stepped in temporarily to help redefine the creative direction of the film. After a few weeks, Cukor handed the reins off to Victor Fleming, who ultimately guided the film through its completion. King Vidor also did an uncredited stint as the last director on the classic movie, shooting the Kansas scenes after Fleming had hustled off to work on \"Gone With the Wind.\"George Cukor had shepherded \"Gone With the Wind\" for producer David O. Selznick for two years of preproduction. It was one of the highest-profile film productions ever; even the casting sessions made headlines around the U.S. But after a few weeks of shooting, disagreements between Selznick and Cukor over the story and the pace of shooting led Selznick to remove Cukor from the film. To replace him, Selznick went back to Victor Fleming, who'd also taken over \"The Wizard of Oz\" from Cukor. That was going along fine until Fleming had a \"breakdown\" and walked off the set. He'd eventually return, but only after (uncredited) director Sam Wood had been brought on in his absence.It all worked out well enough. When adjusted for inflation, \"Gone With the Wind\"still ranks as one of the highest-grossing films ($3.4 billion) of all time and is still critically acclaimed.Kirk Douglas wanted the lead role in \"Ben Hur\" but he lost it to Charlton Heston. Not easily deterred, Douglas optioned the novel \"Spartacus\" was based on, so that he might produce and star in it himself. To bring the vision to life, he first went to director David Lean, who turned him down. He then settled on director Anthony Mann, who had done work in the Western genre that had excited Douglas. At the end of the first week of shooting, Douglas decided that Mann didn't understand what the film needed to be and replaced him. Having worked with Stanley Kubrick previously on \"Paths of Glory,\" he was brought in to finish \"Spartacus.\" The rest is history, and 1960's \"Spartacus\" remains a classic of cinema.\"Ratatouille\" was a Disney/Pixar film released in 2007, but the lead time of an animated movie is long. Jan Pinkava, who had directed the Oscar-winning short \"Geri's Game,\" pitched \"Ratatouille\" in 2000 and soon work began in earnest. For five years he toiled on the film before Pixar decided they weren't confident in the direction the film was taking. In 2005, they replaced Pinkava as the main director and installed Brad Bird, who had directed \"The Incredibles.\" He rewrote the story and, in 18 short months, crafted one of the finest films in Pixar's oeuvre.AdvertisementBrad Pitt and director Steven Soderbergh worked for years to make \"Moneyball,\" the real-life story of the manager of the Oakland A's, Billy Beane. In a last-minute rewrite, Soderbergh had a vision for the film that included documentary interviews and a real indie vibe. But Sony looked at the $60 million price tag and didn't think that would fly. Just days before principal photography began, Sony shut down the film, leaving Pitt scrambling to figure out how to make the movie. That's when they called in Aaron Sorkin to help revise the script and found Bennet Miller, the director of 2005's \"Capote,\" to step in and take the helm. \"Moneyball\" went on to be nominated for six Academy Awards, earned a 94 percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, and made back more than twice its budget at the box office.Ron Howard had his career reinvigorated by George Lucas' second film, \"American Graffiti.\" Lucas also helped him step into the director's chair and even produced \"Willow\" for him to direct. He also was one of the first directors Lucas asked to direct \"The Phantom Menace.\""},

Ultimately, your best bet for dealing with these uneven skin issues is to find out what's causing them. There are several different possibilities.One of the most common reasons for red blotches is a reaction to some type of beauty product that you're using [source: Zamosky]. Try testing your products on the inside of your wrist to see if they are causing an allergic reaction. If nothing happens, an allergy might still be to blame, but it's likely to be\u00a0something else that you're touching, inhaling or ingesting [sources: Hyde]. If that's the case, it's probably time to see an allergist. In the meantime, try taking an antihistamine to see if the problem goes away.AdvertisementA sun allergy can also cause red blotches. If you notice that you seem to develop them after spending a day in the sun, you've probably solved the mystery. But keep in mind that some medications, like birth control and antibiotics, can make you break out when combined with sun exposure. If you think this might be what's causing your blotches, make an appointment to see a physician [source: American Academy of Dermatology].Most of the time, red blotches on your face are just the result of an annoying allergy, but in some cases they might be signs of something more serious. Skin conditions like rosacea and eczema not only produce red blotches, they can make your skin incredibly uncomfortable as well. If your red, blotchy skin seems to be a more of permanent fixture, it's time to pay a visit to the dermatologist for proper treatment [source: Zamosky].For more information on how to care for your skin, check out the links on the next page."},

While too little sleep can eventually contribute to your death, there's little evidence to suggest you'd kick the bucket right away.If an extended period of non-sleep were to kill you immediately, it would likely be due to an indirect cause, like a car crash or an accident on the job. That's because staying awake for too long alters perception and judgment, leaving you more prone to errors and accidents [source: Harvard Medical School]. After just 18 hours without sleep \u2013 say you woke up at 6 am for work and stayed out with friends until midnight \u2013 your level of impairment is equal to that of someone with a blood alcohol level of 0.05 percent. By 24 hours of no sleep, you're operating at the same level as someone with a BAC of 0.10 percent [source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]. At this level of impairment, it's certainly possible to run into trouble on the road or in the workplace.AdvertisementEven if you're lucky enough to escape short-term death due to an accident, lack of sleep could still take you down in the end. Chronic sleep deprivation is linked to a host of health effects from obesity to diabetes to cardiovascular disease [source: Harvard Medical School].Of course, both of these scenarios reflect relatively short periods of wakefulness \u2013 you're still getting sleep, just not enough of it. But what if you just flat out stopped sleeping? The longest that a human has ever stayed awake under observation is 11 days, when student Randy Gardner achieved this record as part of a science fair [source: Gillin]. Sources vary on how much the lack of sleep affected Gardner's mental state, but most agree that he recovered within a few days with no long-term effects.Beyond Gardner's 11-day ordeal, scientists know precious little about how long human can survive with no sleep at all \u2013 because in order to properly test this duration, someone would have to die. Even the CIA limits sleep deprivation in detainees to 11 days [source: Miller]. Studies performed on rats estimate that they die after two weeks of no sleep [source: Gillin]. Others suggest that some rats can last as long as 32 days [source: Palmer]. While it's not clear what kills the rats, it could be related to weakening of their immune system, brain damage, stress or even hypothermia brought on by the lack of sleep [source: Palmer]."},

For example, depression can be a symptom of bipolar disorder; whereas psychosis can accompany schizophrenia. However, when major depression and psychosis coexist outside of other conditions, it's called psychotic depression.Despite the fact that depression is a fairly common mental health disorder, the likelihood that it would be present with psychosis is much slimmer. In fact, only about 15 percent of people with major depression exhibit the primary signs of psychosis: hallucinations and delusions [source: Croft].As a team, depression and psychosis can be particularly harmful -- putting their victims at risk for alienation, reduced quality of life, hospitalization and even suicide. And while psychotic depression is not a common mood disorder, it accounts for more than a quarter of all hospital admittances for depression [source: WebMD].Even though psychotic depression is a serious problem, the news isn't all bad.

Here are some lesser-known facts about this Jamaican superstar.AdvertisementDuring a lean early period in Jamaica, Bob Marley decided to move to America and earn some money. His mother had moved to Wilmington, Delaware, and sent her son a plane ticket. During an eight-month period in 1966, he worked on the Chrysler assembly line and also as a lab assistant at DuPont. But his heart wasn't in either job and when his visa ran out, he moved back to Jamaica to continue with music. One legacy of that brief time is that Wilmington holds a People's Festival every summer in Marley's honor. It's organized by a man named Ibis Pitts who befriended Marley during the future reggae star's time there.\u00a0Marley was born in 1945 to Cedella Booker, a 19-year-old black woman and Norval Marley, a 60-year-old white Englishman, in the rural parish of St. Ann, Jamaica. Bob's mixed race heritage was a source of discomfort, and people in his community disparaged him. \"Them call me half-caste, or whatever. Me don't dip on the black man's side nor the white man's side.\u00a0 Me dip on God's side, the one who create me and cause me to come from black and white, who give me this talent,\u201d he said in 1975.Norval Marley rarely saw his son and wife and, after Norval's death, Bob and his mother moved to Trench Town, an impoverished area in the Jamaican capital Kingston. There, Cedella lived with Thaddeus Livingston and his son Bunny, who as Bunny Wailer, became a founding member of the group that later became known as the Wailers (and eventually Bob Marley and\u00a0the Wailers). Cedella and Thaddeus also had a daughter together, named Claudette.One very memorable performance for Marley and the Wailers took place during celebrations for Zimbabwe's independence in 1980, which came after a bitter civil war against an apartheid government. Marley was personally invited to perform at the ceremonies because his songs had been an inspiration to the guerilla forces. But then a riot broke out. \"After the third tune, there was total confusion, people running from everywhere ... There was tear gas over the walls of the stadium,\" remembered Tommy Cowan, who was MC at the concert. \"We realized that when he played 'I Shot the Sheriff,' \u2014 there was prisoner of war camp a few chains away, and ... 7,000 of them broke jail intending on coming into the stadium, so they threw tear gas at them \u00a0... The guys broke down the gate, they came in and sat down. They got a standing ovation because these were the guys who [had] actually fought [for freedom].\"This video was shot at the Keskidee Community Centre, a black arts center in London in 1978. Marley chose the site and the video shows him singing and playing with kids recruited from various stage schools, including a young Naomi Campbell, the future supermodel. \"I was just seven, and didn't know what it would involve. I didn't realise Bob Marley would be standing right next to me, tucking me under a blanket. He was the most handsome man, with beautiful bone structure; mellow, too, and soft-spoken, with a strong Jamaican accent, the kind I already knew from home,\" she said in an article in The Guardian.AdvertisementMarley was synonymous with the Rastafarian religion, which originated in Jamaica. Among its beliefs: The former emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie, is part of the Trinity; ganja (marijuana) is a sacred herb that can bring one closer to Jah (God); and the comb and scissors are tools of Babylon (corrupt Western society), which gave rise to the dreadlocks style \u2014 co-opted by many non-Rastas.While Marley vigorously promoted the Rasta faith in many songs, there is evidence that he changed beliefs before he died. Haile Selassie was distressed to learn that people were worshipping him as a god and sent a representative from the Ethiopian Orthodox Church to Jamaica to try and convert the Rasta faithful to Christianity. A year before his death from cancer, the archbishop of the local Ethiopian Orthodox Church, Abuna Yesehaq, baptized Marley and gave him the name Berhane Selassie (Light of the Trinity). Yesehaq presided over his state funeral in Jamaica where Marley was buried with a guitar, a Bible and a stem of ganja in his casket.Bob Marley was a famous proponent of marijuana use, and the Marley family has gotten on the cannabis bandwagon launching a line of herb-related products.Originally Published: Feb 3, 2017"},

Before long, he's jabbering about prophecies, and you're busy trying to scrub imaginary blood off your hands.Those guilt-manifested stains may not be going anywhere, but your skin is. On the extreme end of the spectrum, excessive scrubbing can actually wear away your skin the same as if you took a sheet of sandpaper to it. Individuals who suffer from obsessive-compulsive disorder sometimes wash their hands until they're red and sore -- or actually bleeding. If you've found yourself experiencing similar symptoms from repeated grooming rituals, see a health care professional.AdvertisementRepetition isn't the only potential scrubbing risk to skin. Remember, skin thickness and sensitivity vary across your body. While it's perfectly acceptable to take a pumice stone to the soles of your feet (even this can be overdone), you'd never want to apply the same skin care regimen to your face, where the skin is far thinner and more susceptible to damage. Likewise, some skin care products are specially formatted for use on sensitive skin areas like the face, incorporating more sensitive ingredients and gentler exfoliants.Even with the most gentle cleanser products, there's a limit to how much scrubbing a face can take. Fortunately, however, scrubbing isn't a major contributor to damaged skin and wrinkles. The main culprits, according to Everyday Health, are cigarettes, chemical irritants and -- oddly enough -- facial expressions.Still, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that washing and scrubbing can only make you so clean. After a point, your skin can actually become \"too clean.\" For this reason, irritant contact dermatitis is an occupational risk for health care professionals, who frequently wash their hands and use gloves. Excessive scrubbing can wear away the stratum corneum, the outermost skin barrier. If this barrier is regularly breached, skin dryness, irritation, cracking and other problems may result. Damaged skin also tends to host a higher number of pathogens [source: Larson].So don't get too carried away with your personal hygiene regime and, by all means, don't get too heavy-handed. Otherwise, you'll find yourself facing rather diminishing returns on cleanliness -- to say nothing of sleepwalking around some dreary Scottish castle.Explore the links on the next page for more skin care tips."},

If it didn't, it sure scared a lot of artists.Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\" may have changed the music industry forever. If it didn't, it sure scared a lot of artists.Family members of the late Marvin Gaye publicly accused Thicke and \"Blurred Lines\" co-writer Pharrell Williams of copying elements of Gaye's 1997 song \"Got to Give it Up.\" Williams and Thicke pre-emptively sued the Gaye estate to get a court declaration that there was no copyright infringement. However, Thicke and Williams lost the case and were ordered to pay the Gaye estate millions.AdvertisementThis, in theory, created a huge problem for musicians. Sure, artists had already been sued over sampling songs \u2014 that is, using parts of older songs and repurposing them for new production \u2014 and not paying royalties to the original creators, but this suit was different. \"Blurred Lines\" didn't sample Gaye's original song. Instead it was \"influenced\" by the 1977 classic, using a similar cowbell progression.Not only could musicians be sued for unattributed samples; it seemed like they could be sued for making songs that sound like songs that came before them. This demonstrated a dilemma for artists. Was there any song to make without worrying that some obscure (or well-known) artist would accuse you of plagiarizing? And did the case create a fear of using samples that's so risky that sampling music would soon become obsolete?Not so fast, according to Dawaun Parker, a producer whose credits include songs for 50 Cent, Eminem and Jay Z. \"[The Robin Thicke lawsuit] made producers more careful, but we always sort of knew people were getting sued,\" he says. Artists like MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice faced lawsuits in the early '90s for sampling songs without clearing the original work. Parker insists that sampling is as prevalent as ever, with musicians finding ways to skirt the rules in order to use samples without having to face legal ramifications. This is especially true for artists who don't have big record labels behind them to spend the money needed to pay for samples, a cost that can get up to six or seven figures.\"People are sampling as much as they ever did,\" Parker confirms. \"There are new plugins and programs people are using to obscure samples and make them harder to detect.\" Artists are also being more creative with their sampling in order to make them less distinguishable, he says. While the Kanyes of the world can use entire basslines or vocal samples for hooks, more artists are distorting and splitting up samples to make them less obvious. As a result, often the sampled musicians may not even know their songs are being used.In another twist, a few enterprising artists are publishing original music on YouTube or SoundCloud for the sole purpose of being sampled. \"The goal is to ... have artists use their songs as samples and let them get publishing or even production credits on those songs,\" says Parker. One such producer is Antman Wonder, who creates full albums of instrumentals that producers such as DJ Premier sample for entirely new songs. It's a win-win as producers have songs readily available for sampling and up-and-coming artists have opportunities to earn publishing credits and make names for themselves.\u00a0As for bigger artists, they're still sampling music and paying the cost. When artists get sampled, most of the money goes to whomever owns the publishing rights to the song, and they divide the earnings with the original musicians and/or songwriters based on how individual contracts and agreements are written. It is up to the record labels using the sample to broker the deal in order to use the music, whether that means offering the original songwriters publishing rights to the new song, paying a flat fee or even giving producer or writing credits to the original creators. Some artists who have owned their publishing or have a say in what happens to their music, have denied artists access to samples, or else have met them in court.But in the end, the trick is perfecting the ability to hide samples so those court dates never happen.\"Artists are constantly finding ways to work around having samples recognized,\" Parker concludes. \"If technology gets to the point where you can obscure the sample so no one can recognize them, then the game is over.\"  Not even babies are safe from issues of copyright infringement. An infamous 2007 case involved Universal Music Group sending a cease and desist over a YouTube video of a toddler pushing a cart to 29 seconds of Prince's \"Let's Go Crazy.\" The court case was groundbreaking in determining the limits of fair use.\u00a0"},

The very term conjures up images of red balloons, blinding science and burning beds -- images of Eileen and Mickey spinning right round like a record as they do the safety dance in Key Largo. You get the picture. Nobody is sure exactly which artist was first declared a one-hit wonder. The Web site phrases.org claims a writer from the Winnipeg Free Press first used the term in print in 1977, as a counter to the band Abba's success. But the Web site notes that it appeared to be a known phrase.For artists who carry the burden of this sobriquet, it's a tag that sticks. You hear band names like Men Without Hats and Timbuk 3, and those three words creep into your brain. Sadly, people like Thomas Dolby, Nina Hagen and Gary Numan are part of this select club. It's probably especially tough for someone like Numan, who had a successful recording career in England, but never placed more than one song, 1980's \"Cars,\" on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. In fact, Numan continues to record and tour, which is more than can be said of many of his one-hit counterparts.AdvertisementAlthough the term is typically associated with the recording industry, the one-hit stigma isn't reserved for just singers. History is rich with famous flame-outs, from painters and authors to inventors and athletes. In fact, many baseball players' major league careers consist of just one single hit, making them literal one-hit wonders. New York Mets player Chris Jelic had only one hit, but it was a home run. Not to be outdone, a St. Louis Cardinal catcher named Keith McDonald had only three career hits, also all home runs.In baseball, just one hit means you failed in your career. In the music business, you're lucky to get a recording contract, much less chart even one bona fide hit. So being a one-hit wonder can't be as bad as it seems, right? We'll let you decide after you take a look at the following famous one-hit wonders."},

He won at least once in all but two years from 1973-85 and finished among the top 10 money winners eight times in his career.

Every airline does this, but there's one airline that takes clean to the next level. And it's an airline you've probably never heard of.Phoenix Air Group transports severely ill and highly contagious patients from one part of the world to another. It's also the airline that transports Ebola patients out of Africa to hospitals where they can get advanced medical care.AdvertisementTypically, Ebola patients airlifted out of Africa are health care workers who've contracted the virus through working with infected people under insufficient medical conditions. For example, in August 2014, a special plane flew two health care workers from Africa to Atlanta, Georgia, for treatment after they contracted the virus.During an Ebola outbreak, health care workers are among those most at risk of contracting the disease. Health care workers often perform their jobs in remote areas under unsanitary medical conditions and can come into contact with patients' bodily fluids, which transmit the disease [source: Freedman].Symptoms of Ebola include:If someone contracts Ebola and begins exhibiting symptoms, he or she can rapidly become severely ill. Getting a patient back to his or her home country for medical care is paramount, and air travel is the quickest way to do it. However, because the more severe symptoms involve bodily fluids, a patient must be transported in the safest, most sterile way possible in order to prevent infecting others.Enter Phoenix Air.The two health care workers flown from Africa to the United States in summer 2014 didn't travel on a regular passenger plane or even a private jet. They traveled on what Phoenix Air calls \"Emergency Rooms in the Sky.\" These planes, used exclusively for patient evacuation and transfer, are custom equipped to handle sick and contagious people.Providing air ambulance services for more than 20 years, Phoenix Air first partnered with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2003 during the SARS outbreak [source: Crist]. The two organizations worked together and designed the perfect airplane to transport contagious patients safely from one end of the world to the other, without spreading infection. The CDC has official guidelines for all air medical transport services. These incredibly comprehensive guidelines include [source: CDC]:Fortunately, the CDC never needed their services during the SARS outbreak, but when the Ebola patients needed help, Phoenix Air was ready.So how do you take a regular plane and turn it into a safe, sterile ambulance in the sky while ensuring the health and safety of the pilot, the crew and the medical professionals on board (not to mention the patient)?"},

While it might sound funny to us humans who indignantly deal with stresses like job security, don't bat it away like an amusing string just yet.AdvertisementWe've known for a while that cats have perceptually sensitive whiskers that allow them to navigate and investigate, as explained in the BrainStuff episode below. The long hairs help them detect air currents and judge the size of spaces. But the drawback is that they're also physically sensitive; touching them against something can trigger stress or discomfort, especially if they're not providing information to the cat. So when you see, for instance, a kitty carefully scooping food out of its dish to eat off the floor, it might not simply be playing with its food. It could be trying to avoid rubbing its whiskers against the sides of the bowl.The solution? If your cat avoids or becomes aggressive or apprehensive around its food or water dish, try a bowl that is shallow. That allows the kitty to nosh happily without sticking its snout too deep. A plate, of course, would also be fine \u2014 but who doesn't want to give their cat a specially-designed, whisker stress-free $40 dish?Cats can get acne on their cute, furry chins that's sometimes caused or aggravated by plastic feeding dishes, which are porous and harbor bacteria.

But consider this: Netflix \u2014 once the premier DVD-by-mail service \u2014 is now the leader in streaming video and a worldwide powerhouse. The company's metamorphosis over the last two decades was the subject of a recent three-part series on TechStuff, a podcast hosted by Jonathan Strickland.To briefly recap the company's early history, Netflix was founded in 1997 by software engineers Reed Hastings and Marc Rudolph. The business provided DVDs by mail through an online rental and sales site, a major change to the then-popular brick-and-mortar movie rental shops such as Blockbuster and Family Video. DVDs were also a new format at the time.AdvertisementOver the next several years, Netflix pioneered concepts such as a subscription service offering unlimited monthly rentals for one fee, no late charges and a personalized recommendation system to predict movie choices for members. By 2005, Netflix had 4.2 million members.Things seemed great when the company unveiled streaming in 2007, which let you watch TV shows and movies on your personal computers. By 2008 \u2014 the starting point of TechStuff's third and final podcast on the topic \u2014 Netflix expanded streaming to the Xbox 360, Blu-ray disc players and TV set-top boxes. But it now faced a major competitor: Hulu, a joint operation between NBC Universal and News Corporation, unveiled that same year.Hulu did not offer subscription services like Netflix. Instead, its videos were free, but ad-supported. Hulu also offered the five most-recent episodes of currently airing shows. Netflix, in contrast, had ad-free videos, which people loved. But you paid for them, and the only available shows were older ones.The two companies battled over the years, along with newer streaming competitors Amazon and YouTube. And Netflix had one notable stumble: Qwikster. Hastings came up with the idea in 2011. With DVDs fading and streaming surging, Hastings decided to split the company in two, with Qwikster devoted to DVD rentals and Netflix the streaming arm.But the change meant customers who wanted both would have two accounts, two payments, two queues, etc. After one month of loud complaints, Hastings abandoned the idea.Netflix solidified its stature as the leading streaming service in 2013, when it added original programming to its offerings with the debut of \"House of Cards.\" The series about Washington intrigue won eight Emmy nominations its first season, the first time a web-only show was awarded such accolades.Today, Netflix is the world's largest streaming company, with more than 130 million memberships in 190 countries, as of 2018. The company added nearly 7 million memberships in just the third quarter of 2018. According to IndieWire, Netflix released 82 original movies in 2018 and 700 new or exclusively licensed programs. The content budget is a whopping $13 billion. \"So not everything on Netflix is 'Fuller House.' Thank goodness,\" quips Jonathan.And while Netflix still rents DVDs, Hastings jokes he'll deliver the final disc to a customer \u2014 in person, no less \u2014 around 2030.Rumor once had it that Reed Hastings, who co-founded Netflix with Marc Rudolph, came up with the idea after Blockbuster charged him a $40 late fee for \"Apollo 13.\" The rumor was discredited."},

Take the elbows, for instance: They're bony, without a lot of flesh to dig into. So it seems particularly cruel that they're a prime location for certain itchy conditions, like psoriasis.This chronic autoimmune disease causes rapid turnover of skin cells. As a result, dry patches and itchy scales show up on the skin. The type of psoriasis most likely to affect the elbows is plaque psoriasis. It can also appear on the knees, lower back and scalp.AdvertisementThere are a variety of methods to treat psoriasis, including medication and light therapy. What's not recommended, however, is scratching the areas where you experience an outbreak. This will cause the patches and scales to thicken, causing more itchiness in a never-ending cycle. But if your elbows itch, that doesn't necessarily mean you have psoriasis. If you don't see raised red patches (called plaques) or silvery scales, chances are your elbows are irritated for a different reason.Another possible cause of itchiness is atopic dermatitis (AD). This bothersome condition, which causes very dry skin around the elbows, knees, neck and face, can lead to incessant scratching. Henry Wager Halleck, a Union general during the Civil War, is believed by modern scholars to have had AD because he was constantly scratching his elbows [source: Cropley]. In fact, the habit was so excessive that the Secretary of Navy who served with the general complained about it in his published diary.Of course, you don't have to end up like Gen. Halleck.

She reaches into a magic pouch, smaller than a thimble, and retrieves magic dust. Hours later you awaken, rested, but a rub of your eyes reveals sand around your lashes. The truth behind \"eye sand,\" also known as eye boogers, sleep dust, eye gunk and eye schnooters, is not quite as delightful as the fictional ministrations of a sleep fairy. Eye boogers are a substance that forms on the outer corners of the eye or along the lash line, usually during sleep. They can be dry, with a sand-like consistency, or can feel wet, like mucus.To understand eye boogers, we must first learn more about tears, the liquids secreted around the eyes. Tears are made of three layers: a lipid layer, an aqueous layer and a mucin layer. The lipid, or oily layer, is called meibum and is made by the meibomian glands at the rim of the eyelid. The aqueous layer comprises water, electrolytes and proteins. Mucin, a type of protein, is secreted by the conjunctiva, a thin, clear membrane that covers the white portion of the eye. During the day, tears keep the eyes moist, wash away foreign particles and clear the eyes of discharge [source: Managed Care Eye Institute].AdvertisementAt night, when blinking all but ceases, this discharge \u2014 a combination of mucus, oil, dust and skin cells \u2014 begins to pool in the corners of the eyes and along the lashes. Rheum, thin mucus that acts as a natural defense mechanism for eyes, also collects in the corners of the eyes and around the lashes at night. Rheum is made of mucin and meibum. This combination of discharge and rheum is called gound, and it is gound that overnight transforms into eye boogers [source: Surtenich].So, why are some eye boogers dry while others are wet? It's all in the eye of the beholder. People who have allergies or frequently rub their eyes may have eye boogers that are wet. Those whose eyes are typically dry are more likely to have dry, sandy eye boogers. Contact wearers can experience a range of eye booger consistencies, from dry to wet, depending on how their eyes respond to the artificial lenses.If you wake up with eyes plastered by boogers, use a warm, wet washcloth to soften and then remove them. They're not dangerous, just a bit inconvenient [source: Nierenberg]."},

Researchers have studied the farting habits of Atlantic and Pacific herring, which make high-frequency sounds by forcing air out of their anuses to \"talk\" to each other in the dark. The farts encourage other fish to cozy up as the group bunks down for the night [source: Owen]. It's a flatulent friendly environment that humans, who have been known to emit bed-clearing farts, just don't share.And, while we don't use flatulence to communicate like these finned farters, everyone, from glamorous celebrities to powerful politicos, passes gas. In fact, the average person farts between 10 and 20 times a day [source: Ohio State University]. A fart is a potent mixture of swallowed air and bacterial byproducts that ferment in the intestine. These byproducts \u2014 nitrogen (59 percent), hydrogen (21 percent), carbon dioxide (9 percent), methane (7 percent) and oxygen (4 percent) \u2014 combine to create a flammable gas that is heavier than air and, because of the hydrogen sulfide, contains a scent that is sometimes reminiscent of a rotten egg. Even so, all farts don't smell the same because of the varying amounts of bacteria and yeast in each person's digestive system [sources: Men's Fitness, Cohen].AdvertisementWhile anecdotal evidence circulating on the Internet states that farts travel an average of 10 feet (3 meters) per second, or nearly 7 miles per hour, a scientific determination of fart speed is more difficult to pinpoint. If we were to calculate the velocity of a fart, the kinetic theory of gases would offer useful guidelines. All gases \u2014 including those that escape the body during a fart \u2014have macroscopic properties that include temperature and pressure related to molecular motion. When gases are at the same temperature and volume, they will exert the same pressure against their containers. And, the greater the temperature of the gas, the more kinetic energy it will have, because heated atoms move faster than cooled atoms.Taking into the account the temperature, pressure and kinetic energy of molecules, the kinetic theory of gases can predict gas speed. Keep in mind, however, that the molecular makeup of various gases causes them to have different speeds. Calculating the speed of a fart would require factoring the speed of not only the methane, but also carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide [source: University of Waterloo].Measuring fart speed is problematic because of the many variables. The composition of the gas itself, which can vary by food and by person, means the calculation would change for each fart. However, it is theoretically possible to find an average fart speed based on the typical composition and volume of an average fart. According to Ohio State University, the typical fart volume is about 2 liters a day and the average person farts 10 to 20 times a day [source: Comstom].In the end, it may be easier to gauge the sound of a fart than the speed.

Changing social media accounts, the bureaucracy of a legal name change \u2014 all of it has led to an upward tick of women opting to stick with their own surname, according to some sources.So when it comes time to have children, are more straight parenting couples choosing to go a nontraditional route when choosing a surname? More specifically, are they opting for the children to take mom's maiden name?\u00a0AdvertisementLaurie Scheuble is a professor of sociology at Penn State University, and she says it's not easy to track any information or trends about naming but that it's clear that there's still an overwhelming cling to tradition. One BabyCenter survey said that just 4 percent of families decide to give the baby the mom's last name.\"There is so little research in the area,\" Scheuble says in an email. \"Most children carry their father's last name. Even when women make an unconventional last name for their choice (kept their birth surname at marriage, hyphenated) they give their children the father's last name.\"In fact, Scheuble's research says that 90 percent of women with an unconventional surname (read: not their husband's) will give their children the male surname. (Note: The sample in Scheuble and colleague David R. Johnson's research consisted of 600 married, straight women on staff at a university system.) But Scheuble did find that while children's last names overwhelmingly followed a conventional pattern, middle names did not.\"Women who kept their birth surname or hyphenated at the time of marriage are more likely to give their children their birth surname as a middle name (about fifty percent of these women give their children their birth name as a middle name),\" she says.Stefanie Le Jeunesse's young children were all given her surname. She says it was partly about her own pride in the name, and partly an intentional feminist action. \"I love my last name,\" Le Jeunesse says in an email. \"It's beautiful; it's rare; it honors a part of my family that I cherish. I saw no valid reason why my children should have their father's last name instead of mine \u2014 patriarchal tradition has never been compelling to me \u2014 and I did the work to grow and nourish them, so my partner and I agreed that it was my decision what to name them.\"But it hasn't escaped her attention that the practice is rare, and brings with it some outside confusion. \"Everyone who asks us to fill out paperwork assumes my partner is not our children's father,\" she says. \"He has a very hard time when he has to parent alone in any official capacity (doctor appointments, school stuff, etc.). We get a lot of mail addressed to The Partner's Name Family, even though he's the only one with a different surname.\"And that doesn't include the societal strain. Family members cautioned her partner that giving the children the maternal surname could be the first sign she planned to take off with the children, for one.Scheuble says that a patriarchal model is certainly at play. \"As a society, we are absolutely gendered with our naming beliefs. We think women who take on their husband's last name at marriage are more committed to the marriage. There are a number of studies that show this,\" she says. \"Interestingly, we do not think the husband is less committed to the marriage since he kept his birth surname at the time of marriage.\"Le Jeunesse doesn't regret her choice, and doesn't see it as that much different from picking out first names for children. \"We put so much thought and care into the names we give our children,\" she says. \"But we often pass on surnames that we don't like, that have unfortunate connotations or carry heavy burdens we could easily just release.\"While this article focuses on maternal naming in male and female couples, it's important to note that gay and lesbian couples also must grapple with unconventional naming traditions.

There are no cones, rods or lenses. There are no tympanic membranes or miniscule bones. Yet scientists know less about taste than they know about sight and hearing -- senses that are far more complex. Why is something seemingly so rudimentary so complicated and controversial? Why is taste so mysterious?To start with, most people confuse taste with flavor. Taste is a chemical sense perceived by specialized receptor cells that make up taste buds. Flavor is a fusion of multiple senses. To perceive flavor, the \u00adbrain interprets not only gustatory (taste) stimuli, but also olfactory (smell) stimuli and tactile and thermal sensations. With spicy food, the brain will even factor in pain as one aspect of flavor.Advertisement\u00adTesting sensation is also a subjective science -- taste perhaps more subjective that most. Some people have inherited genetic traits that make certain foods taste disgusting. Others, called supertasters, have abnormally high concentrations of taste receptors. To their heightened palates, bland food tastes perfectly flavorful. And, as we all know, food tastes differently to different people -- we don't all like the same flavors.\u00ad\u00ad\u00adIn recent years, scientists have expanded the definition of taste, allowing one, and possibly two, primary tastes into the original canon of four -- sour, bitter, sweet and salty. They've challenged the tongue map, the biology-class staple that charts distinct regions of taste. Food scientists have even tampered with taste receptor cells, blocking or stimulating them in an effort to cut sweeteners and salt out of food without sacrificing flavor.In this article we'll learn about the physiology and psychology of taste.\u00ad"},

It hails from the Akita region of Japan, a prefecture (or state) in the north of the island. Originally all light in color, the Akita was first mentioned in Japanese literature around A.D. 712, and is depicted on much older pottery excavated in that country.Hellen Keller asked for and was given an Akita after she toured the country in 1937 and learned the story of Chu-ken Hachiko (in Japanese, \"faithful dog Hachiko\") [source: Dog and Kennel].Are dogs humankind's best friends?

It's possible you missed that particular period of history.Which might be why you've probably never heard of Hagoromo Fulltouch Chalk \u2014 unless, of course, you're a mathematician. Chalkboards have been disappearing from educational institutions for decades, but math is possibly its last stronghold. Mathematicians prefer writing complex theorems in chalk than with a whiteboard marker or a smartboard. And Hagoromo chalk has been described as the \"Rolls-Royce of chalk.\"AdvertisementFounded in 1932 in Nagoya, Japan, the company that became Hagoromo Bungu barely survived WWII, but went on to produce 90 million sticks of chalk a year by 1990. By this time, mathematicians from all over the world coveted the product. According to chalk connoisseurs, it's dense and difficult to break, produces very little dust, writes more smoothly and erases more cleanly than any other chalk in existence.After the company's sales peaked in 1990, though, chalkboards began disappearing around the globe, and with it sales of the world's most sought after chalk. In 2014, Takayasu Watanabe, the head of the third-generation family business and grandson of Hagoromo's founder, announced he was in very poor health and rather than saddle his three daughters with a flagging company, he would just shut down production.There was, of course, an uproar amongst the world's mathematicians. Academics began stockpiling the stuff \u2014 calculating how much Hagoromo they needed to last them the remainder of their careers.

A Korean school teacher, Shin had been importing Hagoromo chalk to Korea for a decade, and approached Watanabe about buying the secret formula for Hagoromo chalk. After some serious deliberation, Watanabe gave in and gifted Shin the equipment to make the chalk, as well as the mysterious secret chalk recipe. Not only that, the identical twin brothers who had been primarily making Watanabe's chalk moved to South Korea to take over Shin's manufacturing of Hagoromo.So the math world can heave a sigh of relief for now.

Although Americans have celebrated AAPI Heritage Month every year since 1992, when President George H.W. Bush signed legislation that permanently designated May as the commemorative month, it started out as a weeklong celebration in 1979 \u2013 thanks to the efforts of a woman named Jeanie F. Jew.Jew was a board member of the Organization of Chinese Americans and a Capitol Hill staffer when she approached government officials about acknowledging and celebrating Asian Americans for their accomplishments. She took on this challenge after noticing the lack of Asian and Pacific representation during the Bicentennial celebrations of 1976. It was personal for Jew, as her great-grandfather had helped build the Transcontinental Railroad.AdvertisementJew enlisted the support of Ruby Moy, an administrative assistant to former New York Representative Frank Horton, and the two worked to gain support for a proclamation. Rep. Horton introduced a bill in 1977 that called for the first 10 days in May to be Pacific/Asian American Heritage Week, while Hawaii Senator Daniel Inouye introduced a similar resolution.The drafters chose the month of May to celebrate two historic events: The first Japanese immigrant arrived in the U.S. on May 7, 1843, and the Transcontinental Railroad was completed on May 10, 1869. About 20,000 Chinese workers took part in the building of this railroad and 1,200 died from explosions, avalanches and other disasters during its construction.The two bills failed, but the drafters didn't let that discourage them. The legislation needed at least 218 members of Congress for the bill to pass the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee, so the sponsors got to work (the bill was revised to reflect the Census Bureau's designation of the community as \"Asian/Pacific\" instead of \"Pacific/Asian.\")Jew and Moy founded the Asian Pacific Congressional Staff Caucus, while Jew also founded and chaired the National Coalition for an Asian/Pacific American Heritage Proclamation. The Organization of Chinese Americans, Japanese American Citizens League and the Organization of Chinese American Women also advocated for the bill. Thanks to their persistence, 231 Congressional representatives co-sponsored it and it passed with massive support in both the House and the Senate.In 1978, President Jimmy Carter signed the resolution declaring May 4-11 Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week, and the celebration started in 1979. Over the next decade, Presidents Carter, Reagan and Bush passed annual proclamations for Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week. In 1990 Congress expanded the celebration to a month, and in 1992 it became an annual celebration in perpetuity.President Barack Obama expanded the commemoration to include Pacific Islanders and Native Hawaiians in 2009 and so the month is now known as Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.Before the first Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, it would take you half a year to get from New York to California. After the railroad was built, it took a week to go that same distance."},

It's often used in dairy flavorings like butter or cheese and in brown flavors like caramel or butterscotch. It's known in particular for its use in the butter flavoring of microwave popcorn, and because of the severe lung disease that some workers experience from inhaling diacetyl on the job.In May 2000, eight people who had worked at a plant in Missouri that manufactured microwave popcorn developed bronchiolitis obliterans, a rare interstitial lung disease. An interstitial lung disease is one in which the lungs become scarred, or fibrosed. In bronchiolitis obliterans, the lung's smallest airways, the bronchioles, become damaged and inflamed ( in this case, by the particles of diacetyl). Because this condition was first associated with diacetyl's use in popcorn flavoring, it has become known as \"popcorn lung\" or \"popcorn worker's disease.\"AdvertisementDiacetyl affects mainly the lungs, but it can also affect your eyes, nose, throat and skin. Symptoms can start gradually and worsen over time, or happen suddenly and be very severe. Exposure to diacetyl can cause your eyes to sting, and your nose and throat to burn. If the chemical comes in contact with your eyes, it can cause a chemical burn needing immediate medical attention. Diacetyl can also irritate your skin and cause a rash. Typical respiratory symptoms include a persistent cough and breathlessness when exerting yourself, and wheezing even when you don't have a cold. The symptoms generally don't resolve, even when you're no longer exposed to the vapors or spray. The damage to your lungs can be permanent, and in extreme situations, may require a lung transplant or even lead to death."},

The whole wild story is contained in just three verses at the start of Genesis, chapter six. The King James Version goes like this:In the original Hebrew, the term for these giants and \"mighty men\" is Nephilim, which is derived from the Hebrew naphal meaning \"to fall.\" In that sense, this race of giants, born of unholy unions between divine \"sons of God\" (i.e., angels) and mortal \"daughters of men,\" are better translated as \"the fallen ones.\"While the giant Nephilim are barely mentioned in the Genesis narrative, they were the subject of great fascination in later apocalyptic literature, especially the Book of Enoch. In that text, which didn't make it into the Bible, a group of lusting angels conspires to sleep with human women, giving birth to a race of giants that spoil God's creation so completely that he has no choice but to send the floodwaters and wipe Earth clean.AdvertisementScholars say there are two possible reasons why the Genesis account of the Nephilim is so short.\"It's either a much longer story that got truncated in the text, or it was so common of a story that the authors of Genesis didn't bother to write down the whole thing,\" says Kevin Sullivan, a religion professor at Illinois Wesleyan University who specializes in ancient Jewish and Christian mysticism with a focus on angels and demons.Across the Ancient Near East and Mediterranean world, there were longstanding myths of gods falling in love (or lust) with human women and spawning \"god-men\" of superhuman size, strength and power. In Ancient Greek mythology, for example, Zeus fathered the hero Heracles (Hercules in Roman myth) from a tryst with the beautiful human Alcmene.Those demi-god figures, well-known to the ancient authors and readers of the Hebrew Bible, were the \"mighty men of old\" and \"men of renown\" referred to in Genesis. And this short text provides a passing explanation of how they came to be.\"They're superhuman because what they represent is something God never designed,\" says Sullivan. \"They're a hybrid between beings that should have stayed in heaven and beings that should be on Earth. The Nephilim are not divine in the sense that they're heading back to heaven, so they kind of trundle around the Earth as this weird mix.\"AdvertisementThe three-verse Genesis account of the Nephilim only hints at the notion that the unions between the \"sons of God\" and the \"daughters of men\" were a transgression. But later Jewish writers ran with that idea and expanded the cast of characters to include a rebellious and sinful band of angels called \"the Watchers.\"In the text known as the \"Book of Enoch,\" likely written between 300 and 200 B.C.E., a group of 200 angels led by the angel Semjaza hatch a plot to take wives from the \"beautiful and comely\" daughters of men. They know that what they're doing is a \"great sin,\" so they make a pact to follow through with it at all costs and suffer the consequences together.The rebellious angels are called by the Aramaic word iyrin, which is derived from a word meaning \"awake.\" Therefore, iryin has sometimes been translated as \"the awakened ones,\" but more often they're called \"the Watchers,\" because their job as angels was to remain vigilant and watch over mankind. Later in the Book of Enoch, even the loyal angels are called Watchers, but the name is mostly associated with the bad guys.AdvertisementIn the \"Book of Enoch,\" the Nephilim begat by the Watchers and human women aren't the heroic \"men of renown\" of Genesis, but \"great giants whose height was three thousand ells,\" which is more than 3,000 meters (~9,840 feet) tall. In their insatiable hunger, the monstrous Nephilim eat all of mankind's food, and when the food runs out, they start eating the men themselves.Not only do the Watchers bring these blood-thirsty giants into the world, but some of the fallen angels teach the women \"charms and enchantments,\" how use roots and plants for sorcery, as well as how to make jewelry and makeup for the \"beautifying of the eyelids.\" To the men, the Watchers teach metallurgy and how to fashion \"swords, and knives, and shields, and breastplates.\"\"And there arose much godlessness, and [mankind] committed fornication, and they were led astray, and became corrupt in all their ways... And as men perished, they cried, and their cry went up to heaven,\" The Book of Enoch says.It is only then that God intervenes and tells the angels to warn Noah of the coming flood, intended to \"heal the earth that the angels have corrupted.\" God further commands his loyal angels to \"destroy all the spirits of the reprobate and the children of the Watchers, because they have wronged mankind. Destroy all wrong from the face of the earth and let every evil work come to an end.\"AdvertisementIn Genesis, chapter three, Adam and Eve are blamed for introducing sin into the world when they eat the forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Later in Genesis, God decides to destroy his creation with the flood because of the \"wickedness of man\" and repents that he ever made man at all. Noah is the only righteous man on Earth, so God spares him and his family.But the Book of Enoch paints a very different origin story for sin. Here, it isn't mankind that screws everything up, but the Watchers and their heinous offspring. Sullivan says that this version of the creation story dates to the Second Temple Period of Judaism, when there was a prevailing belief in a cosmic struggle between the forces of good and the forces of evil, represented here by the Watchers.\"There's this huge amount of literature during the Second Temple Period that provided a pretty significant competing narrative to Genesis,\" says Sullivan. \"It says that God created humans in His image and they were good, but it was the angels that messed it all up. The reason there's evil in the world is because of these divine beings.\"Sullivan says that these two competing narratives around the origin of sin existed simultaneously within Judaism for hundreds of years, with different Jewish sects latching on to both stories. Fragments of the Book of Enoch, for example, were among the Dead Sea Scrolls alongside other apocalyptic texts that foretold a final war between the divine forces of good and evil.When we get into the first centuries C.E., though, Judeo-Christian thinkers like Paul help to develop a Christian theology that centers on Adam and Eve's transgression as the \"original sin\" for which all of mankind needs to be saved. In the emerging Christian orthodoxy, humans are the sinners and only Jesus Christ can make them whole through his saving grace.The saga of the Watchers and the Nephilim took a back seat, and the \"Book of Enoch\" was relegated to the pseudepigrapha, non-canonical literature of questionable authorship.The 2014 movie \"Noah\" featured characters known as the Watchers, angels that disobeyed God by coming down to help Adam and Eve, and were punished by being transformed into rock monsters."},

Roosevelt.There was no evidence to support these claims and, decades later, Ronald Reagan declared internment was a \"mistake\" based solely on race, implicitly recognizing that these fears were rooted in racism.As the war progressed, the government began seeking Japanese Americans from the camps to serve in the U.S. Army. The government presented residents in the camps with a loyalty questionnaire. Two questions \u2014 questions 27 and 28 \u2014 were particularly controversial, asking Japanese Americans if they would renounce any loyalty to Japan and serve in the U.S. military.About 6,700 individuals \u2014 including a fair number of second-generation Japanese American men, who became known as the \"no-no boys\" \u2014 answered \"no\" to both questions. By answering \"no,\" they challenged the U.S. government for depriving them of their rights and treating them as enemies.\"The no-nos were responding to this illegal confinement of them \u2014 there was no reason given for their mass confinement. There was no justification for holding citizens within those camps,\" Okihiro says.For their refusal, the no-no boys were incarcerated in a federal penitentiary at Fort Leavenworth for the duration of the war, according to Okihiro. Okihiro argues that the no-no boys' defiance showed they were \"true Americans.\"\"What they were trying to do was to have the U.S. live up to its constitution and the promises afforded to all citizens. If that's not patriotism, I don't know what is,\" Okihiro says.AdvertisementWhile their American-born children were granted citizenship, Asian immigrants could not acquire the same legal status for much of American history.This lack of citizenship status dates back to the 1790 Nationality Act, which limited citizenship only to \"free white persons.\" But after World War I, many people, including Asian Americans, were seeking citizenship through the courts and demonstrating they were \"white.\" Two of the most notable were Bhagat Singh Thind, a Sikh immigrant from the Indian subcontinent who served in the U.S. Army, and Takao Ozawa, an immigrant from Japan who had lived in the U.S. for 20 years.Both appealed to the federal court on racial grounds. Ozawa argued before the Supreme Court in 1922 claiming to be white because he had adopted American culture. Thind argued before SCOTUS in 1923 that he deserved citizenship because he was Caucasian because he grew up in the Caucus Mountains. The court denied both Thind and Ozawas' citizenship based on race.\"The Supreme Court said, \"No, you're not white, racially, so you don't qualify,\" Okihiro says. Yet, their challenges show how Asian Americans resisted laws that limited their naturalization, believing they were entitled to their full rights as Americans. \"Takao Ozawa and Bhagat Singh Thind challenged that exclusion of Asians [as] 'aliens ineligible for citizenship' from 1790,\" Okihiro says. Thind, who had served in the army, eventually was granted citizenship in 1936 when a bill was passed providing citizenship to anyone who served. But it wasn't until the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 that every Asian immigrant finally became eligible for citizenship under the law of the land. \"Asians were not immigrants like Europeans, and, unlike Europeans, [were] never intended to be citizens of this country by the founders of this nation,\" Okihiro says. \"But despite all that, they stayed, and they made laws for them and their children became American.\"AdvertisementEven though Filipinos comprise the third largest group of Asian Americans in the U.S., their history has often been overlooked in the history textbooks.Okihiro describes the Manila galleon trade, which brought Filipino indentured workers to Mexico. From Mexico, the Filipino workers eventually made their way to California, Louisiana and beyond.Additionally, Filipino indentured workers \u2014 along with Japanese and Chinese workers \u2014 were brought to work in sugar plantations in Hawaii and on the West Coast to serve as a cheap source of labor.\"Now, these workers who came to Hawaii and to the West Coast, over time, they began to see that they might want to stay here [in the U.S.]. And when they did that, they began to demand rights,\" Okihiro says.That led to the formation of unions, with Filipino farmworkers like Larry Itliong and Philip Vera Cruz banding together with Mexican civil rights activists Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta to boycott non-union grape growers in the Delano Grape strike.Thus, the United Farmworkers' Movement was born. Leaders like Itliong went up and down the coast, from the fields of California to salmon canning industries in Alaska, to organize workers.\"This is an amazing thing, because agricultural workers were never organized by unions, until Asians and Mexicans got together and formed those agricultural unions,\" Okihiro says.AdvertisementA Chinese American man, Vincent Chin, went out for a night on the town with his friends on June 19, 1982. Chin's friends were hosting a bachelor party in advance of his wedding.But Chin never got to walk down the aisle. Two white men, fueled by racist hatred blaming Japan for the unemployment of Detroit auto workers, identified anyone who seemingly appeared Japanese as a target for their hatred.\"Chin was a Chinese American who was born in the United States, but it didn't matter to them,\" Okihiro says.The two white men murdered Chin on that same night in Detroit. For their heinous crime, the murderers received no prison time and only a $3,000 fine.The ruling in Chin's death sparked a wave of activism among Asian Americans, and his story remains important for Asian Americans to this day. Actress and producer Gemma Chan is working to develop a podcast and film about Chin's life.AdvertisementAsian Americans have a long history of speaking up in the face of injustice, but have often been portrayed in the media as the model minority, a trope that depicts Asian Americans as successful, hardworking individuals who don't cause problems or challenge the status quo.The model minority trope set Asian Americans apart from other minority groups, including African Americans, seemingly driving a wedge between the two communities.\"The model minority, then, arises largely out of the 1960s during the Civil Rights Movement, and African Americans are badass and they're disrupting American society. And the U.S. needed a good, quiet, docile [model] minority,\" to use as a counterpoint, Okihiro says.But Okihiro says Asian Americans have long been pushing back against this trope, which ignores their lived history of racism.Many Asian Americans have recognized the shared struggle between Asians and Black individuals. Asian and Black activists collaborated on the Third World Liberation Front at UC Berkeley, which led to the formation of ethnic studies programs in California. Japanese Amerians also supported African Americans in school desegregation efforts.\"They worked together, the NAACP and the JACL [Japanese American Citizens League], on a discrimination case against Mexican children in California. And from that working together came Brown v. Board of Education,\" Okihiro says.However, there is perhaps no one more famous for bridging the divides between the two communities than Japanese American activist, Yuri Kochiyama, who passed away in 2014. Kochiyama was forced to relocate with her family to an internment camp during World War II, which shaped her activism.As a result of their experiences of \"victimization during World War II, many Japanese Americans began to understand that racism against them is allied to racism against black people,\" says Okihiro.Kohiyama organized sit-ins to protest civil rights violations and collaborations with the Freedom Riders, who challenged segregation in the South.Kochiyama also formed a brief friendship with Black activist Malcolm X and was present when he was assassinated.HowStuffWorks may earn a small commission from affiliate links in this article.Portrayals of Asian Americans in mainstream media, like the movie \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" often focus on highly affluent individuals. However, a 2018 Pew report found Asian Americans had the highest income inequality of any racial group in the U.S, due in large part to stark differences in education level and migration patterns between individuals from different regions of Asia."},

With hospitals running out of beds, oxygen and medicines, the official daily death toll has averaged around 3,000. Many claim that number could be an undercount; crematoriums and cemeteries have run out of space.In the past several weeks, the world has looked on in horror as the coronavirus rages across India. With hospitals running out of beds, oxygen and medicines, the official daily death toll has averaged around 3,000. Many claim that number could be an undercount; crematoriums and cemeteries have run out of space.The majority of India's population are Hindu, who favor cremation as a way of disposing of the body. But the Muslim population, which is close to 15 percent, favors burying its dead.Generally, tradition holds that the body is to be cremated or buried as quickly as possible \u2014 within\u00a024 hours for Hindus, Jains and Muslims, and within three days for Sikhs. This need for rapid disposal has also contributed to the current crisis.Hundreds of families want their loved ones' bodies cared for as quickly as possible, but there is a shortage of people who can do the funerals and last rites. This has led to a situation where people are paying bribes in order to get space or a furnace for cremation. There are also reports of physical fights, and intimidation.As a scholar interested in the ways Asian societies tell stories about the afterlife and prepare the deceased for it, I argue that the coronavirus crisis represents an unprecedented cultural cataclysm that has forced the Indian culture to challenge the way it handles its dead.AdvertisementMany Americans think of cremation happening within an enclosed, mechanized structure, but most Indian crematoriums, known as \"shmashana\" in Hindi, are open-air spaces with dozens of brick-and-mortar platforms upon which a body can be burned on a pyre made of wood.Hindus and Sikhs will dispose of the remaining ashes in a river. Many shmashana are therefore built near the banks of a river to allow for easy access, but many well-off families often travel to a sacred city along the banks of the river Ganges, such as Hardiwar or Benares, for the final rituals. Jains \u2014 who have traditionally given significant consideration to humanity's impact\u00a0on the environmental world \u2014 bury the ashes as a means to return the body to the earth and ensure they do not contribute to polluting rivers.The workers who run shmashana often belong to the Dom ethnicity and have been doing this work for generations; they are lower caste and subsequently perceived as polluted for their intimate work with dead bodies.The act of cremation has not always been without controversy. In the 19th century, British colonial officials viewed the Indian practice of cremation as barbaric and unhygienic. But they were unable to ban it given its pervasiveness.However, Indians living in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Trinidad often had to fight for the right to cremate the dead in accordance with religious rituals because of the mistaken and often racist belief that cremation was primitive, alien and environmentally polluting.AdvertisementThe earliest writings on Indian funerary rituals can be found in the Rig Veda \u2014 a Hindu religious scripture orally composed thousands of years ago, potentially as\u00a0 early as 2000 B.C.E. In the Rig Veda, a hymn, traditionally recited by a priest or an adult male, urges Agni, the Vedic god of fire, to \"carry this man to the world of those who have done good deeds.\"From the perspective of Hindu, Jain and Sikh rituals, the act of cremation is seen as a sacrifice, a final breaking of the ties between the body and the spirit so it may be free to reincarnate. The body is traditionally bathed, anointed, and carefully wrapped in white cloth at home, then carried ceremonially, in a procession, by the local community to the cremation grounds.While Hindus and Sikhs often decorate the body with flowers, Jains avoid natural flowers for concern of inadvertently destroying the lives of insects that may be hidden within its petals. In all of these faiths, a priest or male member of the family recites prayers. It is traditionally the eldest son of the deceased who lights the funerary pyre; women do not go to the cremation ground.After the ceremony, mourners return home to bathe themselves and remove what they regard as the inauspicious energy that surrounds the cremation grounds. Communities host a variety of post-mortem rituals, including scriptural recitations and symbolic meals, and in some Hindu communities the sons or male members of household will shave their head as a sign of their bereavement. During this mourning period, lasting from 10 to 13 days, the family performs scriptural recitations and prayers in honor of their deceased loved one.AdvertisementThe wave of death from the COVID-19 pandemic has forced transformations to these long-established religious rituals. Makeshift crematoriums are being constructed in the parking lots of hospitals and in city parks.Young women may be the only ones available to light the funerary pyre, which was previously not permissible. Families in quarantine are forced to use WhatsApp and other video software to visually identify the body and recite digital funerary rites.Media reports have pointed out how in some cases, crematorium workers have been asked to read prayers traditionally reserved for Brahmin priests or people from a higher caste. Muslim burial grounds have begun to run out of space and are tearing up parking lots to bury more bodies.AdvertisementWhile other important rituals such as marriage and baptism may take on a new appearance in response to cultural changes, social media conversations or economic opportunities, funerary rituals change slowly.Historian Thomas Laqueur has written on what he calls \"the work of the dead\" \u2014 the ways in which the bodies of the deceased participate in the social worlds and political realities of the living.In India's coronavirus pandemic, the dead are announcing the health crisis that the country believed it had conquered. As recently as April 18, 2021, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi was holding crowded political rallies, and his government allowed the massive Hindu pilgrimage festival of Kumbh Mela to proceed a year early in response to the auspicious forecasts of astrologers. Authorities began to act only when the deaths became impossible to ignore. But even then, the Indian government appeared more concerned about removing social media posts that were critical of its functioning.India is one of the world's largest vaccine-producing nations, and yet it was unable to make or even purchase the needed vaccines to protect its population.The dead have important stories to tell about neglect, mismanagement or even our global interdependence \u2014 if we care to listen.This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Legend says this is where Lao Tzu descended from the heavens. "], "date": "May 5, 2021", "content": "The \"Tao Te Ching\" was compiled around 300 to 250 B.C.E, but its wisdom resonates as powerfully today as it did more than two millennia ago. The slim text was written in ancient China during the Warring States period, a three-century period of incessant warfare between various Chinese states. In 81 stanzas, the \"Tao Te Ching\" pushes back against the all-too-human desire for \"more\" \u2014 more money, more status, more power, more things \u2014 and focuses instead on simplicity, harmony and a return to Tao or \"the way.\"The author of the \"Tao Te Ching\" is Lao-tzu (also written as Laozi), an honorific title that means \"Old Master.\" According to biographies written centuries later, Lao-tzu (pronounced lao-zuh) was a sage-like archivist in the Zhou court who served as an early teacher of Confucius. Lao-tzu refused to write down his teachings, but when he decided to leave his homeland for India, he was pressed by a border guard to share his wisdom. Legend has it that the border guard dutifully copied down the words of Lao-tzu in the \"Tao Te Ching,\" which means \"The Book of the Way and Its Power.\"Modern scholars disagree on whether an historical figure named Lao-tzu ever existed, or whether he and his writings were a compilation of Chinese wisdom passed down over the centuries. Eventually, what started out as a philosophy called Taoism (or Daoism) soon became a religion with Lao-tzu as the earthly personification of the Tao \u2014 the ultimate power that gives order to the universe.Reading the \"Tao Te Ching\" today, it feels like Lao-tzu is directly addressing 21st-century problems: runaway consumerism, overdevelopment, the single-minded pursuit of profit and growth at the expense of the environment, and disregard for the poor and marginalized. But that's because it was written at the turn of the Iron Age, when new technologies fueled a population explosion and ensuing conflicts over land and resources.\"The 'Tao Te Ching' was written in a political climate where people were doing just what they're doing today,\" says Livia Kohn, professor emerita of Daoist Studies at Boston University and author of \"Daoism and Chinese Culture.\" \"They were destroying the environment and there were all of these power mongers waging war on people. It was a very messy time that they lived in.\"Lao-tzu's message, then and now, is that the human urge to dominate and alter the world to fit our desires is ultimately foolish. There is an underlying nature to everything that is organic, simple and easy, and the way to find it is through calmness and quiet intuition, not through ambitious and aggressive tactics.Here are five eye-opening passages from the \"Tao Te Ching\" that offer a way to maintain a sense of harmony and balance in an often-chaotic world, courtesy of the legendary Taoist master Lao-tzu.AdvertisementThere is a paradoxical logic to a lot of Lao-tzu's best-known sayings, and this one is a great example. The best form of action is \"no action\"? What does that even mean?First of all, something is definitely lost in the translation. The Chinese word for non-action is wu wei, which is sometimes translated as \"doing nothing,\" but Kohn prefers the wording, \"not forcefully acting.\"That's because the real meaning of wu wei is not to do anything that isn't in accordance with Tao, the natural order of things. Non-action means swimming with the current instead of against it, or of bending with the wind instead of trying to remain rigid. Forcefully acting, meanwhile, is like blowing up a mountain to build a bigger and more direct roadway.\"What Lao-tzu is talking about is becoming aware of what the natural flow is and just going with it,\" says Kohn. \"Rather than taking the mountain down, there are probably comfortable ways to go around it.\"Bonus saying: \"The Way of Heaven is to benefit others and not to injure. The Way of the sage is to act but not to compete.\"AdvertisementTaoism doesn't teach an outright rejection of desire. The type of desire to be avoided is the one driven by materialism, which defines success as the accumulation of more and more things. What Lao-tzu emphasizes is sufficiency, of knowing when you have enough to be content instead of needlessly striving for more.\"Following the Tao doesn't mean having zero desires,\" says Kohn. \"You can have ambitions, goals, and plans, but they should all be within a framework that's doable, that's considerate of others and that's not rapacious and destructive.\"Bonus saying: \"There is no calamity greater than lavish desires. There is no greater guilt than discontentment. And there is no greater disaster than greed. He who is contented with contentment is always contented.\"AdvertisementEmptiness and \"non-being\" have real value in Taoism. What is a wheel without the empty space at its center? A room is not four walls, but the space in between them. The utility of a clay pot is what can be held inside of it. A bellows only works if there is empty space within it.Lao-tzu teaches that humans, too, should balance being with non-being. The Tao itself is non-being; it is eternal, intangible and unknowable. Kohn says that the Tao is \"the hidden quality at the root of things, the deep sense of cosmic connection, the inherent beauty and goodness in all living beings\" that can only be seen and felt by retreating from the hustle and bustle of life. Look beyond the \"obvious\" or superficial to recognize the value of what isn't there.Bonus saying: \"The Tao that can be told of is not the eternal Tao; The name that can be named is not the eternal name. The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth; The Named is the mother of all things. Therefore let there always be non-being, so we may see their subtlety, And let there always be being, so we may see their outcome.\"AdvertisementWritten during the Warring States period when wise rulers were in short supply, the \"Tao Te Ching\" was published as a political tract as much as a guide to personal well-being. The truly wise ruler or \"sage\" knows that he doesn't know everything. Instead of trying to dictate and control every aspect of people's lives, he or she gives them freedom and lets society find its natural balance.\"The book is addressed to policymakers,\" says Kohn. \"Lao-tzu taught that the people in charge shouldn't think primarily of power and profit, but instead should focus on doing good for the maximum number of people.\"Bonus saying: \"The best rulers are those whose existence is merely known by the people. The next best are those who are loved and praised. The next are those who are feared. And the next are those who are despised.\"AdvertisementThis is easily the most famous passage from the \"Tao Te Ching,\" sometimes translated as \"A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.\" The full quote reads: \"A tree as big as a man's embrace grows from a tiny shoot. A tower of nine stories begins with a heap of earth. The journey of a thousand li starts from where one stands.\"How do you accomplish a really big task or overcome a seemingly insurmountable obstacle? With patience, says Lao-tzu, and by working within your capabilities.\"Start with the first thing, and if that's successful, then you move on,\" says Kohn. \"It doesn't mean you can't have far-reaching goals, but you have to take them one step at a time. Any builder will tell you, you don't start with the roof.\"Bonus saying: \"Difficult undertakings have always started with what is easy. And great undertakings have always started with what is small. Therefore the sage never strives for the great, And thereby the great is achieved.\"HowStuffWorks may earn a small commission from affiliate links in this article.While the \"Tao Te Ching\" is the authoritative text of Taoism, an argument can be made that Benjamin Huff's \"The Tao of Pooh\" \u2014 a charming bestseller that illustrates the principles of Daoism using characters from \"Winnie the Pooh\" \u2014 is the better introduction."},

They brought prosperity, allowed for a new kind of freedom, and caused not a small deal of disruption, to a vast continent, helping to stitch together the pieces of a far-flung and fledgling nation.People still use the train these days. In 2019, Amtrak, America's long-distance train service, hosted more than 32 million trips, a record for the quasi-public company. But outside of some crowded corridors on the East Coast and some localized commuter services in scattered big cities, train travel to most people in the United States now generally seems an anachronism.The American Jobs Plan, President Joe Biden's audacious and wide-ranging infrastructure push, offers up a multi-billion-dollar infusion of cash that aims to change that. In short, Biden's plan is designed to bring train travel back to the future.Amtrak, for one, says it's about time.\"We were created for the country to have a national rail network,\" says Amtrak representative Kimberly Woods. \"We want to continue to build and grow on what we have and offer the country more. That's why we have this vision that we're talking about now.\"AdvertisementWhen Biden made his announcement of the American Jobs Plan late in March 2021, it included $80 billion \"to address Amtrak's repair backlog; modernize the high traffic Northeast Corridor; improve existing corridors and connect new city pairs; and enhance grant and loan programs that support passenger and freight rail safety, efficiency and electrification.\"Also new to the plan that Amtrak says could boost ridership by 20 million trips by 2035: Routes from Phoenix to Los Angeles; from Los Angeles to Las Vegas; and Houston to Dallas. More than 30 extra routes could be added. Many existing ones would be expanded. Every state but South Dakota would have at least one stop.The $80 billion figure, just part of the $2.7 trillion Jobs Plan, was eye-popping. It's also far from guaranteed. Biden's plan is just that; a plan. It's up to Congress to settle on the final figures.As bold as the $80 billion, though, was what Amtrak says it can do with that kind of financial boost. The company \u2014 it's celebrating its 50th anniversary, created by Congress when other railroads abandoned the passenger side of the business for more lucrative freight trains \u2014 this year released a map of what the rail system might look like in 2035 with the right kind of investment. Included were routes connecting Southern cities like Atlanta, Nashville, Savannah and Montgomery, Alabama, \u2014 services that at this point do not exist.Adding routes and improving the ones already in existence, both the Biden administration and Amtrak claim, will provide more Americans with more opportunity for travel, especially many who are shut out of more expensive means of transportation. The plan also checks off two more of Biden's campaign promises: to create more jobs and to attack the climate crisis. Traveling on Amtrak, the company claims, means some 83 percent fewer greenhouse gases emitted than driving and up to 73 percent fewer than flying.\"We believe it will address the global climate crisis, it will get people out of their vehicles and onto the trains for more travel, whether it's for work, a weekend trip or a vacation trip,\" Woods says. \"We just believe that better rail service means cleaner air, less traffic and happier people.\"AdvertisementAhh, but the cost. For years, Amtrak, which already is heavily subsidized by federal and state governments, has struggled to get the funding it says it needs to carry out its mandate to connect America. Building out train service in a country as huge as the United States \u2014 laying down rail, buying equipment like the new high-speed trainsets that run on the popular Boston-New York Acela route, maintaining the system, making sure it's safe \u2014 is expensive. Some think prohibitively so.Even the $80 billion, many say, is not nearly enough to do what Biden and others envision.The libertarian Cato Institute \u2014 a group opposed to big government spending \u2014 compared a desire for America to be among the leaders in high-speed rail to \"wanting to be the world leader in electric typewriters, rotary telephones or steam locomotives, all technologies that were once revolutionary but are functionally obsolete today.\" According to Cato, investing in rail is much more expensive than airlines or highways with much less chance of making that money back.As it is, the $80 billion money earmarked for Amtrak will be hard to push through Congress, even though both the House and the Senate are currently controlled by Democrats who are behind Biden's plan. Many politicians agree with the need to improve infrastructure. Many agree on the rail system's potential to fight the climate crisis, and to provide transportation solutions to some of the neediest people in the country.But that cost ...For Amtrak's part, the money \u2014 whatever figure Congress finally lands on \u2014 would be money well-invested, in America and its future.\"Our vision is to connect new city pairs across America,\" Woods says. \"We believe that our vision rises to the urgent challenges of our times.\"Amtrak has the right to use any and all of America's rail infrastructure. Many of those rails, of course, are being used now by private, freight railroads. But the relationship between freight and passenger trains is not always a symbiotic one. In 2019, freight trains caused more than 1 million minutes in passenger delays \u2014 all illegal. By law, passenger trains are supposed to be given preference over freight trains."},

Lights flashing, flags fluttering, sirens blaring, traffic-light ignoring. It's a commuting Armageddon, no matter which side of the political aisle (or city street) you happen to be stuck on.The granddaddy of these, of course, the jam de resistance, is the presidential motorcade. When the U.S. president comes to town, it's time to get off the roads. As fast as you can.AdvertisementEver since that day nearly 117 years ago when Teddy Roosevelt reportedly became the first president to use a car in an official capacity, parading through the streets of Hartford, Connecticut, everybody's been moving aside to let the Commander in Chief through. From The New York Times on Aug. 22, 1902:(Earlier, the Rough Rider had landed, by yacht, in New Haven and taken a carriage ride through that city. \"By proclamation of the Mayor, all traffic over the line of march was suspended,\" The Times reported. \"The city's factories changed the noon hour for the day and the shops were closed between 1 P.M. and 2:30 P.M. The city was gayly dressed in flags and bunting.\")Presidential motorcades always have had an undeniable patriotic panache, even in Washington, D.C., where other motorcades (ferrying visiting dignitaries, diplomats, cabinet members and the political alike about) are pretty pass\u00e9. The presidential inaugural parade, featuring the presidential motorcade, is a red-white-and-blue happening, even as almost every president since Jimmy Carter in 1977 bolted from their limos to hoof it down Pennsylvania Avenue on foot, at least for a bit.Any presidential motorcade, whether in D.C. or another town, must carry off a kind of automobile ballet to get the president safely to his destination.\"While each motorcade movement is unique, thorough planning precedes any protective movement, requiring constant coordination between the Secret Service and its partners,\" Melissa McKenzie, a spokesperson for the Secret Service, said in a thoroughly planned and protective email. \"The Secret Service believes that this thorough planning is the best safeguard against all types of potential pitfalls, but agents are prepared and trained to deal with unforeseen circumstances as they arise.\"Those unforeseen circumstances can be the stuff of tragedy and history. John F. Kennedy was assassinated riding in a presidential motorcade in Dallas. An assassin shot Ronald Reagan as he prepared to get into his limo in a motorcade in D.C. Gerald Ford had to be shoved into his limousine twice in the space of two weeks in California \u2014 once in Sacramento, once in San Francisco \u2014 to avoid assassination.That's why the Secret Service doesn't mess around when it comes to presidential motorcades.AdvertisementMcKenzie points out, carefully, that the Secret Service coordinates with state, local and federal authorities in determining the composition of a presidential motorcade. Often, how well-equipped the local force is determines how many vehicles are involved.\"Motorcades are comprised of numerous types of vehicles belonging to the Secret Service and several other entities,\" McKenzie says. \"While precise alignments and numbers cannot be divulged, most motorcades include, at a minimum, a vehicle for the protectee, vehicles for security personnel, and vehicles for local or state law enforcement support.\"At the virtual center of a presidential motorcade is the presidential limo, which carries the president, a few Secret Service agents, and other high-ranking dignitaries or family members. In December 1941, shortly after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and the U.S. entered World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt became the first to use an armor-plated vehicle.Today's well-armored presidential limo is surrounded by other vehicles in the motorcade, including other decoy limos and many support cars. In a 2016 article, The Drive suggested there may be as many as 20 different limos in the presidential fleet, though we couldn't get McKenzie to confirm this info. When a president visits, the presidential limo and many other cars in the motorcade (however many the Secret Service deems necessary) \u2014 including, perhaps, a spare limo \u2014 are shipped to the destination via Air Force planes.The limo carrying the president is preceded in the motorcade by different vehicles closing streets and clearing the way \u2014 often, local police on motorcycles do that job \u2014 and is closely accompanied by at least one other limo. The two limos move back and forth, swapping places, during the procession, according to The Drive.The current presidential limo is known as \"The Beast,\" a Cadillac hybrid that, if it's like previous presidential limos, sports \"bullet-proof glass, a supply of the president's blood type and an independent air supply to thwart a chemical attack,\" according to TechCrunch.Secret Service details, communications vehicles and other support vehicles (including a lot of heavy-duty SUVs) follow the presidential limo, according to The Drive. The rear of the convoy includes vehicles carrying members of the press, an ambulance and more local police to protect the rear of the motorcade. The Secret Service always is in charge.\"Agents assigned to drive in Presidential motorcades receive extensive training in several areas and they rehearse and research motorcade routes continually,\" McKenzie says.Things don't always go smoothly. A few motorcycle officers assigned to the presidential motorcade in Lake Charles, Louisiana, in May 2019 were injured in an accident. Still, that motorcade got its job done, delivering President Donald Trump safely to his destination, even if there were a few traffic tie-ups along the way.FDR's first armor-plated limo was seized by the Treasury Department from gangster Al Capone in 1932. That car had bulletproof glass, but the body was vulnerable to bullets. The Secret Service started armor-plating limos in 1942."},

Kavanaugh testified in front of the Senate Judiciary committee regarding sexual assault allegations at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill Thursday, September 27, 2018.  "], "date": "Updated: Sep 15, 2019", "content": "In October 2018, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was approved by a very narrow 50-48 Senate vote, after an acrimonious confirmation process fueled by allegations of sexual misconduct and charges that he had given untruthful testimony.In October 2018, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was approved by a very narrow 50-48 Senate vote, after an acrimonious confirmation process fueled by allegations of sexual misconduct and charges that he had given untruthful testimony.But even after he was sworn in, the controversy never stopped swirling around Kavanaugh. An online petition urging the House to reinvestigate Kavanaugh and pass articles of impeachment against attracted nearly 176,000 signatures.AdvertisementAnd now that Kavanaugh has served as SCOTUS on the \"Highest Court in the Land\" for not even 12 months, new rumors of sexual allegations are swirling around him once again. On Sept. 14, 2019 The New York Times published an excerpt of a new book \"The Education of Brett Kavanaugh: An Investigation,\" by Times reporters Robin Pogrebin and Kate Kelly. It includes details of a previous accusation from Deborah Ramirez, which she reported during Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings in 2018. At that time, Ramirez accused Kavanaugh of exposing himself to her at a Yale party when he was a freshman, though Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied the allegation. According to the book, Ramirez\u2019s lawyers provided the F.B.I. a list of as many as 25 people who could possibly corroborate her story, but none were interviewed. One of those, according to The Times story, could have possibly have been a freshman classmate of Kavanaugh's, Max Stier. The Times reporting uncovered that Stier told senators and the F.B.I about a story that would confirm Ramirez's allegations, but the F.B.I. never investigated. This new allegation could threaten to wreck Kavanaugh's confirmation. Several democrats, including 2020 presidential candidates Senator Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Juli\u00e1n Castro and Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), all have called for his impeachment.AdvertisementBut if you're not a history or constitutional law expert, at this point you might be wondering: Can a Supreme Court justice really be impeached? Does it work like a presidential impeachment? And has it ever actually happened before?The answer to all three questions is yes. Article II Section 4 of the U.S. Constitution provides that the president, vice president and all \"civil officers\" \u2014 such as federal judges and Supreme Court justices \u2014 can be impeached, tried and removed from office for treason, bribery or other unspecified high crimes and misdemeanors.But the impeachment clause has only been used once against a Supreme Court justice, and that was more than two centuries ago. As an account from the U.S. Senate Historical Office details, Justice Samuel Chase, an appointee of George Washington, was a staunch federalist with a brash manner who made no secret of his political views, even after President Thomas Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party took control of Congress in 1801. At Jefferson's urging, the House voted 73-32 to impeach Chase. The eight counts accused Chase \u2014 who like other justices of that time, also doubled as a circuit judge and sometimes presided over grand jury deliberations \u2014 of refusing to dismiss biased jurors, excluding defense witnesses in politically sensitive cases, and giving \"an inflammatory political harangue\" to a federal grand jury in Baltimore. In February 1805, Chase went on trial in the Senate, where his attorneys argued that his conduct didn't justify removal from the bench.\"Chase and his defenders (the Federalists in the Senate) argued that (1) Chase had broken no laws (on the theory, totally incorrect but always tried by impeached officials, that only an indictable crime was impeachable); and more important (2) that the accusations against Chase really came down to his professional opinions about the role of the judge in the courtroom, and his decisions during particular trials,\" Randall Calvert, the Thomas F. Eagleton Professor of Public Affairs and Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis, writes in an email.\"Many of Chase's actions and decisions would be beyond the pale today, but were not so unusual in their day,\" Calvert says. \"In particular, many Federalist politicians thought one duty of the judge was to guide the people and protect the Constitution from their mistakes and excesses. While controversial, then, his actions were not widely regarded as being as absurd as they would seem today, when the judge is expected to be a much more neutral figure in the courtroom.\"In March of 1805, Chase was acquitted, when none of the eight counts got the required two-thirds support in the Senate.AdvertisementBut the impeachment of Chase still had a profound effect, by helping to establish that judicial impeachment should be confined to cases of alleged corruption or other illegal conduct \u2014 while also imposing an unofficial taboo against justices engaging publicly in partisan activity. \"After that, no one was impeached for the way they decided cases, but justices stopped giving political opinions, \" explains John Harrison, a Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of Virginia, who back in the 1980s served on a Justice Department commission that studied the issue of impeachment. \"Both sides got something out of it.\"That didn't completely stop Supreme Court justices from engaging in politics, as long as they didn't express their views in court. Justice Smith Thompson actually ran for New York governor in 1828, even though he was still on the court. (He lost.) Another justice-turned-candidate, Charles Evans Hughes, resigned from the court to run unsuccessfully against Woodrow Wilson in the 1916 presidential election, and then returned to the court when he was appointed chief justice by President Herbert Hoover in 1930. President Franklin Roosevelt came close to choosing Justice William O. Douglas as his running mate in 1944, as this 2003 article from The Nation details.But since Chase, no Supreme Court justices have been impeached, though articles have been voted against 13 federal judges, according to the House website. Seven were tried, convicted and removed from office, while three resigned from office before a verdict could be rendered. Three were acquitted.AdvertisementThe impeachment and trial of a Supreme Court justice essentially would follow the same process seen in the judicial cases, according to Harrison. The case would start with an investigation in the House Judiciary Committee, leading to a vote by the full House on impeachment articles, which would then be presented to the Senate.Once the Senate had the charges, it could choose to appoint a committee of senators who would hear witnesses and collect documents. The House would appoint impeachment managers \u2014 essentially, prosecutors \u2014 and the justice and his or her attorneys would participate in the process and have the opportunity to call their own witnesses as well. \"It looks just like a criminal trial,\" Harrison explains. In the end, the committee would compile a record, without making a recommendation on the charges, and then forward it to the full Senate, which could hear additional testimony before voting.Alternatively, the Senate could opt to hold the entire trial before the full chamber, Harrison says. Afterward, senators sometimes will write opinions explaining their votes, just as the justices do after deciding cases.In the unlikely event that Kavanaugh ever is impeached, there will be a certain irony. As this New York Times article details, as a young lawyer, Kavanaugh helped to craft independent counsel Kenneth Starr's case for impeaching former President Bill Clinton, who ultimately was acquitted by the Senate in 1999.In this Washington Post article, University of Chicago law professor Aziz Huq proposed two methods by which Kavanaugh could be removed from the court, without his impeachment. A future Democratic president could appoint Kavanaugh to a lower court post, and a Democratic-controlled Senate could confirm him, thus demoting him. Alternatively, he wrote, Congress could pass a law authorizing a panel of federal judges to determine whether Kavanaugh had violated standards of good behavior, and potentially remove him.Originally Published: Nov 13, 2018"},

Beal started his weed seed experiment, he probably didn't think his contribution to science would still be running 142 years and several generations of botanists into the future. But the Beal seed viability experiment is proof that we can surprise ourselves.Beal \u2014 who was a correspondent of Charles Darwin, if that gives you any context for how long ago the experiment started \u2014 was interested in how long the seeds of a variety of different weed species could sit dormant in the soil before they lost their ability to germinate. AdvertisementWe know seeds can survive a long time in permafrost and in special seed storage vaults, but Beal was interested in how long seeds could survive in the soil. So he planned a long-term study \u2014 a very long-term study: He planted 20 pint bottles filled with sand and the seeds of 21 different common weed species in a secret underground location on the Michigan State University campus, planning to dig up one bottle every five years until they ran out. And so he did, until he retired in 1910, at which point he passed the experiment along to a colleague, who passed it along down the line of Michigan State botanists \u2014 each generation drawing out the time between exhumations to make the experiment last as long as possible.At this point, a new bottle of seeds is dug up every 20 years or so. The seed study caretakers go out under the cover of darkness, partly so nobody notices their trek to the secret location and partly so the seeds won't be exposed to the sun. After that, they take the pint bottle back to the lab and scatter the contents over sterile soil to see which ones germinate and grow. In 2000, botanists Frank Telewski and Jan Zeevaart unearthed and planted the seeds in the 15th bottle, and only one species \u2014 moth mullein (Verbascum blattaria) \u2014 was successful.The 16th bottle was supposed to be unearthed in 2020, but because of COVID-19 restrictions, Telewski and the successors he nominated to take over the experiment after he retires waited until April of 2021. The seeds in this bottle will undergo a series of experiments Beal couldn't have dreamed of: RNA and DNA studies, longevity experiments and possibly even investigations into resurrecting seeds that would have been thought completely done for even 20 years ago.We'll have to wait and see what happens in the following weeks to find out how many seeds actually germinate, though with four bottles left in the ground, the study itself is slated to go on for another 80 years.In 1873, William Beal founded MSU\u2019s W.J.

In 2008 (and 2012 and 2016), former New York City mayor and fellow billionaire Michael Bloomberg also flirted with a White House run as a third-party candidate. Bloomberg ultimately concluded that third-party candidacies are a lost cause and put his money behind the Democrats.But even if American voters are fed up with the two-party system \u2014 68 percent said in 2018 the two major parties don't represent their views and that a third option is needed \u2014 could they ever actually agree on a candidate? And more importantly, is the U.S. electoral system engineered so that any presidential candidate without a D or R after their name doesn't stand a chance of being anything other than a spoiler (see Ralph Nader 2000)? AdvertisementIn 19th-century America, mounting a third-party presidential campaign was as easy as rallying supporters, naming a candidate and passing out ballots. If the major parties \u2014 the Whigs and the Democrats at the time \u2014 nominated lousy candidates at their summer conventions, third-parties like the Liberty party and Free Soil party had plenty of time to get their guy's name on the ballot by November.\"The ballot access rules now totally preclude that,\" says Micah Sifry, author of \"Spoiling for a Fight: Third-Party Politics in America\" and founder of Civic Hall. Independent candidates have to collect crazy numbers of signatures in every state, some with filing deadlines as early as June of the election year. So, it's impossible for a third-party candidate to enter the race after the major party conventions. \"There's absolutely no give in the system.\"AdvertisementEven if a well-organized and well-funded independent presidential campaign gathers all the necessary signatures, fights off the inevitable legal challenges from the major parties, and manages to get its candidate's name on ballots in all 50 states, another significant hurdle remains \u2014 access to the debates.Sifry says that the nonprofit Commission on Presidential Debates has set prohibitively high barriers for entry into the nationally televised debates, which are crucial for name recognition among voters. According to the Commission's rules, candidates need to be polling 15 percent or higher nationally to earn a spot at the debates, which is why you almost never see Libertarian or Green Party candidates behind a debate podium.\"How do you get to be over 15 percent if you're not included in the debates?\" asks Sifry.Just look at the example of Texas billionaire Ross Perot, who ran as an independent in the 1992 presidential election. This was before the Commission on Presidential Debates established its 15 percent rule and Perot was polling at a meager 1 percent a week before the first debate with Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush. Perot's strong performance in all three televised debates led to the greatest third-party performance of the modern era with Perot winning 18.9 percent of the popular vote (but not a single electoral vote).Compare Perot's performance with Libertarian and Green Party candidates Gary Johnson and Jill Stein in 2016, whose low polling numbers (9 percent and 3 percent respectively) barred them from sharing the debate floor with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Johnson won just 3 percent of popular vote and Stein only took 1 percent.AdvertisementWhile Sifry believes that the current electoral process has been \"rigged\" by Democratic and Republican lawmakers to \"artificially advantage them,\" he and others still see a possible, if remote path to victory for an independent.Daniel Franklin, an associate professor of political science at Georgia State University, says that the only way a third party can get traction is by owning a single policy issue that's been completely ignored by the two major parties and has huge salience for voters. He points the Republican Party of the 1850s, a third party that rose to prominence on its anti-slavery stance.\"In the 1856 election, neither the Democrats nor the remnants of the Whig Party would touch the slavery issue with a ten-foot pole,\" says Franklin, \"And in 1860 that gave Abraham Lincoln a political lane to the White House.\"The question, then, is what issue would be salient enough with a large block of the American electorate to propel a third-party to the presidency? Even though more than two-thirds of Americans say they want a third-party option on the ballot in 2020, they have very different ideas of where that candidate should sit on the political spectrum. A third want a centrist party; about 11 percent want a party more liberal than the Democrats; and a fifth want one more conservative than the Republicans, according to one study.Also working against third-party hopefuls is the fact that Democrats and Republicans have gotten very good at neutralizing upstart candidates by co-opting their best ideas. Franklin says that Perot blazed into the popular consciousness in 1992 with his crusade against the deficit, but Clinton and Bush stole his thunder by making the national debt one of their talking points.\"Issues like ending child labor, establishing a minimum wage, the direct election of senators \u2014 all of those were originally third-party ideas that one or both of the major parties adopted,\" says Sifry.2016 Green Party candidate Stein said she didn't \"spoil\" the election for Hillary Clinton because she brought new voters to the polls, but Franklin's research found that voter turnout actually goes down in presidential elections where third-party candidates get significant votes."},

"], "date": null, "content": "The thread count of a set of bed sheets has become one of those numbers \u2014 like IQ, batting average or gas mileage \u2014 that's considered the single most important standard for gauging quality. When you shop for a new set of sheets, every package lists the thread count in big bold numbers: 300, 500, 800! But what does that number mean, and does it even matter?We reached out to the Good Housekeeping Institute (GHI), a top testing ground for home goods since 1900 and awarder of the Good Housekeeping Seal since 1909. Lexie Sachs is a senior textiles analyst at GHI working in the Textiles, Paper and Plastics Lab, one of six full-fledged engineering labs at the institute, which is based in New York City.AdvertisementSachs spends her days putting products like shirts, shoes and bed sheets through the ringer, testing for softness, shrinkage, color fastness, durability, and yes, thread count. Thread count is the total number of threads (vertical and horizontal) in a square inch of fabric.\"The higher the thread count, the more fiber is in the product,\" Sachs explains. \"The idea is that it should feel softer against your skin and be more durable.\"But thread count alone is not a reliable indicator of quality, Sachs also says. In lab tests and consumer trials, sheets with thread counts of 800 or above consistently ranked lower than sheets with more modest thread counts.\"The sweet spot is 300 to 500,\" she says. \"If it gets too high, the cotton could be so thin it becomes weaker. Three hundred to 500 is a good balance between softness and durability.\"There are many other factors equally, or more, important to consider when buying sheets besides thread count. Fiber type is a big one. Cotton sheets have a much different feel than polyester blends, and flannel or jersey sheets (that \"T-shirt\" material) are whole different animals. Consumers have to choose a fiber and feel that suits their personal taste. The wrong fabric with a high thread count is still the wrong fabric.Different weaves of fabric also will affect the way a sheet feels on your skin. A percale weave is the classic \"over-and-under\" weave that makes a sheet feel \"light and crispy,\" says Sachs, while a sateen weave \"floats\" the yarn over several rows at a time, creating a satiny smooth feel.What about Egyptian cotton? High-end sheets often make a big deal about the fact that they're made of 100 percent Egyptian cotton, but does it make a difference? Sachs says that Egyptian cotton has longer cotton fibers (known as \"staples\"), and longer fibers makes them softer and more durable. Shorter fibers can break and feel itchy or even pill \u2014 the endings become tangled and form those annoying tiny knots. That said, lab tests have shown that not all brands advertising Egyptian cotton are actually made from Egyptian cotton, so be skeptical of cheap \"Egyptian\" cotton sheets.False or misleading thread counts used to be another problem. A decade ago, GHI labs found that some sheet manufacturers were using creative math. When higher thread counts became an important marketing distinction in the early 2000s, brands began to count two-ply thread (two strands of thread twisted around each other) as twice the thread count. So sheets with 300 two-ply threads per square inch were advertised as having a 600 thread count. False advertising isn't such a problem anymore.A bigger issue now is that some brands have developed manufacturing processes that boost thread count without improving overall quality. By using ultra-thin polyester blends, textile makers can squeeze more and more threads into a square inch. Again, says Sachs, it's not that poly blends are bad \u2014 it's a personal preference thing \u2014 but an ultrathin thread might not last nearly as long.One of the hardest things about shopping for sheets is that you often don't get a chance to really feel a product on your skin before you buy it. And even if you do, some sheets feel very different after they've been washed. One interesting development is the rise of online-only sheet brands. Many of these companies have generous return policies that let you try the sheets for 30 days or more and still send them back if you're unsatisfied."},

And then, when you've achieved what you set out to do, just when you're at the top of your game, you'll realize that, while your first dream was noble and true, you now have more information than you did when you started out. So your dream changes. Your new dream is bigger and more difficult to realize, but you do it anyway.Repeat into old age, never slowing down, and you might even get nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.AdvertisementThe key to Jane Goodall's persistence seems to have a lot to do with knowing what she liked from a very young age, and then just insisting on doing it. Her father gave her a stuffed chimpanzee when she was a baby, and she took it with her everywhere, even though it was terrifying, by all accounts. She grew up loving to observe and catalog animals, and dreamed of one day living with African animals and writing books about them for a living. Her mother, who was a novelist herself, told Goodall that seemed like a perfectly reasonable idea, even though it was the 1940s, and not at all what middle-class English girls were expected to do.After she finished school, Goodall couldn't afford to go to college, so she worked odd jobs in London for a few years until a friend invited her to visit her family's farm in Kenya. At which point, Goodall immediately quit her job and waited tables until she made enough money to pay for the price of boat fare to Africa. While in Kenya, her friend suggested she contact the paleontologist Louis Leakey, curator of the Coryndon Museum in Nairobi, to discuss primates (Leakey was interested in studying primate behavior in order to better understand early human species). Leaky hired Goodall as his field assistant on a paleontological dig, and later asked her to return to England to research primates and raise money for a long-term observational study on wild chimpanzees at the Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania.AdvertisementIn July of 1960, 26-year-old Jane Goodall began setting up her field station at Gombe, and would become the site of the longest-running wildlife research project in history. British authorities initially balked at the idea of a young woman doing this kind of work unchaperoned, so Goodall's mother Vanne accompanied her for the first few months. Goodall observed the chimpanzees daily for two years before she earned their trust. Her method was just to watch the animals and imitate their actions, recording everything that happened in a field journal.Two of Goodall's most important discoveries during this period had to do with what chimps ate, and how they went about getting food: Goodall was the first to observe chimpanzees killing and eating the meat of small mammals (prior to this, they were thought to be vegetarian), and perhaps her biggest contribution to our understanding of primates was the revelation that chimps used collected and modified grass stems and sticks as tools to fish termites out of their nests. Goodall's discoveries were so significant, Leakey arranged for her to write a dissertation at Cambridge University on the behaviors of wild chimpanzees. It was accepted, and she became one of only eight people ever to graduate from Cambridge with her Ph.D. without first earning her undergraduate degree.In 1964, Goodall married Hugo van Lawick, a Dutch wildlife photographer Leakey sent to record her activity in the field, and their son \"Grub\", born in 1967, spent his early life with his parents at Gombe. After Goodall and Lawick divorced in 1974, Goodall married Derek Bryceson in 1975, who was the director of Tanzania's national parks. During this time, Goodall published books about her experiences and research at Gombe, including \"In the Shadow of Man\", which was criticized by scientists because of Goodall's habit of naming the subjects of her research (she called her most famous study subject \"David Graybeard\"), but the book was wildly popular and has since been translated into 48 languages. As she lived and worked in Gombe, she began to notice changes to the chimpanzees' habitat: deforestation and mining practices forced the animals out of their homes and into smaller and smaller areas.According to the Jane Goodall Institute, more than 1 million wild chimpanzees lived in Africa 100 years ago, but today only a fifth of that population exists. Goodall saw the writing on the wall, which is why, in the 1980s, Goodall changed her focus from observing chimps, to working to protect their habitat. She founded the Jane Goodall Institute in 1977, which works to keep human communities and wild chimpanzee populations in Africa healthy and coexisting peacefully.

This broadcast was a product of over a decade of technological development in TV accelerated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Let's look at how NASA has improved TV technology, starting with those early years.World War II spurred significant advancements in television in the United States. When the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik satellite in 1957, though, the U.S. government was motivated to prove superiority over the Soviets in the space race. President Eisenhower signed into law the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958. Since then, people worldwide have enjoyed many technological advances, including enhancements to television, which can be attributed to NASA's scientific research or financial investments.AdvertisementThe earliest influence of NASA on television was extending the reach of TV broadcasts. One of the issues with wireless communication like TV is having a line of sight between sender and receiver. You're probably familiar with the line-of-sight challenge if you've ever had to locate that perfect place in your home for a TV or radio antenna, allowing you to pick up the most channels with the least interference. Obstacles on the ground and the curve of the Earth make line-of-sight difficult for more than a few miles. Powerful antennas placed on tall towers, buildings and mountains help send signals farther, but their distances are still limited.When NASA launched its first satellite, Explorer I, in January 1958, the range of wireless communication changed forever. Explorer I's primary mission was to gather data about cosmic radiation during its twelve and a half orbits of Earth each day. When the satellite's battery ran out after four months, NASA lost contact with Explorer I. This, combined with the mixed results of successive Explorer satellite launches, set the stage for improving the quality and longevity of satellite communications for future missions [source: JPL].As a result of the boom in satellite technology, NASA helped AT&T launch the first commercial communications satellite, the Telstar I, in 1962 [source: NASA]. Telstar I was used for the first transatlantic television transmission on July 11, 1962, between the U.S. and France [source: IEEE]. In the years that followed, NASA's Applications Technology Satellites Program (ATS) conducted communications experiments that ushered in the multibillion dollar commercial market we have in satellite services today [source: U.S. House].So far, we've looked at how NASA accelerated the growth of television technology through the 1960s. Next, let's look at how the continued work of NASA has contributed to today's TV technology."},

A bloodied actor in a straitjacket stalks his victims in a haunted house attraction. In popular culture, straitjackets are code for \"crazy scary.\"In real life, straitjackets appear far less often \u2014 and very rarely, if ever, in psychiatric hospitals. Largely considered an outmoded form of restraint for people with mental illness, they've been replaced with other physical means to prevent patients from injuring themselves or others.AdvertisementAnd that's when physical restraints are even used at all. Mental health facilities have better tools now \u2014 medication, nonconfrontational techniques, higher staffing levels \u2014 to keep patients safe, says Dr. Steven K. Hoge, a professor at Columbia University Medical School and chairman of the American Psychiatric Association's Council on Psychiatry and the Law.Facilities and doctors operate under a different ethos now, as well, Hoge says. Restraints are viewed as an infringement on a patient's liberties, which mental health care providers are more concerned with these days than they were in, say, 1975, when Jack Nicholson's character was strapped down for electroconvulsive therapy (in an adaptation of 1962's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\").In almost 35 years of practice, including at the maximum-security mental health unit at Bellevue Hospital in New York City, Hoge has never seen or heard of a straitjacket being used to restrain a patient.\"This is like leeches,\" he says. \"It would be something worthy of comment.\"So why the enduring popular interest in straitjackets? There's something provocative about them. Just the idea of being wrapped up in one \u2014 arms folded across midsection, sleeves secured in back \u2014 might prompt even mild claustrophobics to spread their arms and shake them out.And, although straitjacket sales are low, people still make them, and people still use them: on an Ohio man with Alzheimer's disease; on an 8-year-old with autism in Tennessee; on a prisoner in a county jail in Kentucky.But, for one company that makes them, it's a small market.\"You're talking less than 100 units a year,\" says Stacy Schultz, general manager of Humane Restraint, of Waunakee, Wisconsin. The company also sells ankle and wrist restraints, transport hoods and \"suicide smocks\" \u2014 garments designed so the wearer can't tear or roll them.The straitjackets mostly go to \"custodial folks,\" Schultz says \u2014 jails and prisons.And that's probably where, if you were going to find a straitjacket in use, it would be, says Hoge, the psychiatrist. Jails and prisons \u2014 called America's \"new asylums\" in 2014 by the Treatment Advocacy Center, housing 10 times more seriously mentally ill people than state psychiatric hospitals \u2014 lack mental health resources and staffing, Hoge says, and typically don't follow hospital standards.\"You see all sorts of things in prisons that you don't see in ordinary mental hospitals,\" he says.The American Bar Association seems to have taken note. Its Standards on Treatment of Prisoners, approved in 2010, says correctional facilities should not use physical restraints to punish prisoners.Among its list of mechanical devices deemed not OK for meting out punishment: leg irons, handcuffs, spit masks \u2014 and straitjackets.Doctors in the 1800s, often at a loss to explain mental illness, came up with all sorts of reasonings, including sunstroke and novel reading (that's according to the Kansas Historical Society)."},

In the story, the penny falls and kills a pedestrian on the sidewalk below.This is one of those classic urban legends that is untrue but contains a grain of truth.AdvertisementThrowing a penny off the Empire State Building wouldn't kill someone. A penny only weighs about a gram and it tumbles as it falls. Because of the tumbling and the light weight, there's so much air resistance that the penny never really gathers that much speed before it hits its terminal velocity. A gram of weight traveling at a relatively slow speed might hurt a little if it hit you on the head, but it's not going to kill you.The grain of truth embedded in this urban legend is the fact that falling objects -- even ones that seem harmless -- can do a lot of damage. That's why people on construction sites wear hard hats. If a big nut or bolt weighing 50 grams (about 1.8 ounces) falls and hits you on the head, it's going to do some serious damage, and depending on the height it falls from, it could definitely kill you if it hit right on top of your skull.To get an idea of the damage it can do, let's take a look at a bullet. A bullet might weigh 5 to 10 grams, and it leaves the barrel of a gun at anywhere from 800 to 2,000 miles per hour, depending on the type of gun, the type of bullet and the amount of powder behind the bullet. A 44-caliber bullet weighs about 9 grams. Let's assume it leaves the gun at 1,000 miles per hour. That gives it a muzzle energy of about 300 foot-pounds (1 foot-pound is the amount of energy needed to raise 1 pound 1 foot in the air). Three-hundred foot-pounds of energy is clearly enough to kill someone. Even a third of that is enough to kill someone.A 1-gram penny falling from the Empire State Building might reach 100 miles per hour. It has a little less than 1 foot-pound of energy when it hits, and just hurts a little.If a 50-gram nut, or a roll of pennies weighing 50 grams, were to fall from the Empire State Building, it would fall about 1,000 feet. Ignoring air resistance, it would reach a velocity of about 250 miles per hour. That gives it energy of about 100 foot-pounds, which is fatal if it hits you on the head. If you're wearing a hard hat, however, you'll survive."},

Although there were many competitors, some almost identical in appearance and performance, it was the Piper J-3 Cub that came to represent the private pilot's dream. Further, the plane earned its place as an American classic in peace and war.Classic Airplane Image GalleryAdvertisementAlthough it carried Bill Piper's name, the Piper J-3 Cub's roots lay with another pioneer designer and self-taught aeronautical engineer, C. Gilbert Taylor. With his brother Gordon, he formed the Taylor Aircraft Company. There, the pair built the E-2, which, with its slim fuselage, open cockpit, parasol wing, and Brownbach \"Kitten\" engine, won the name of Cub.C.G. Taylor continued to develop and refine the classic aircraft over the years. After Gordon died in 1928, C.G. was joined by William T. Piper, a successful oilman. The two parted company in 1935, with Taylor forming his own firm to produce basically the same aircraft, modified to have side-by-side seating.In 1935, Piper Cub sales climbed to over 200; by 1941, Bill Piper, the master salesman, had boosted sales to 3,197. Nearly twice that number of the classic airplane were purchased by the military services during World War II, when Cubs were used for training, liaison, medical-evacuation, observation, and many other tasks.The simple, honest nature of the Piper J-3 Cub made it a marvelous trainer -- you had to fly it at all times, especially during take-off and landing. On the other hand, it was quite forgiving of student mistakes. In the field, its simple steel-tube, wood, and fabric construction made it easy to repair and maintain. When the Cub was used in what would later be called a forward air-controller role, its low speed and good visibility were invaluable, as was its ability to take off and land from tiny fields.Wingspan: 35 ft. 2-1/2 in.Length: 22 ft. 4-1/2 in.Height: 6 ft. 8 in.Empty Weight: 680 lbsGross Weight: 1,220 lbsTop Speed: 87 mphService Ceiling: 11,500 ft.Range: 220 milesEngine/Horsepower Continental: A-65/65Seats: 2"},

Instead, they were captured by robotic drones equipped with cameras and piloted by operators on the ground.AdvertisementEver since the Federal Aviation Administration issued new regulations in 2016 making it easier for news organizations to use the flying robots, drones have become a hot new news-gathering tool. Prior to the change, a drone had to be piloted by someone trained and licensed for manned aircraft, requiring hours of cockpit experience. The new rules only require an operator to study and pass a test to be certified for drones.The updated rules \"resolved a lot of uncertainty about TV station use of drones,\" Henry H. Perritt, Jr., a professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law and co-author of the 2016 book \"Domesticating Drones: The Technology, Economics, and Law of Unmanned Aircraft,\" says in an email.In fact, some journalism training programs are making big investments in a drone future. Matt Waite is a journalism professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who heads the school's Drone Journalism Lab. He's trained 390 journalists across the nation in the past year on how to use drones, and he says that probably about half of them have gone on to obtain FAA certification. He estimates that somewhere between \"dozens to low hundreds\" of U.S. news outlets \u2014 not just TV stations, but newspapers and radio stations, too \u2014 now use unmanned aircraft in news gathering.Drone use is rising at a time when the once seemingly ubiquitous news helicopter is in decline. While definitive numbers aren't available, TVNewsCheck, an industry publication, estimated in 2013 that there were only 100 to 120 news choppers still flying around the country, down from 180 before the late-2000s economic downturn.For news outlets, drones are a far less expensive news-gathering tool than helicopters, which can cost $3 to $4 million apiece, including the cost of cameras and equipment, and consume a significant amount of fuel.\"You can buy a really good drone kit for about $1,800,\" says Waite. \"That's about what it would cost you to fly a helicopter for an hour.\"Waite says that drones are a more affordable way to supply the ever-increasing demand for video clips that can be posted on websites, and that the technology is well-suited for covering certain types of news events: \"tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, massive traffic backups, stories like that,\" he says.Perritt adds: \"Drones have the potential to supplant news helicopters to some degree and to provide aerial coverage for stations that cannot afford helicopters.\" Because of their lower cost, he says, \"the main advantage is that every news crew can go out with one and decide when its coverage might be useful.\"Drones have another advantage as well \u2014 since they're unmanned, journalists don't face the same risks that they would in news choppers. A recent helicopter accident in New Mexico, for example, claimed the life of a veteran TV reporter for a local station.But drones also have limitations that give helicopters an advantage for other types of stories, according to Waite. For example, the FAA prohibits operators from flying drones directly over people, which would make it difficult to get close to a massive protest rally or a celebratory parade for a sports championship win. Most drones' electric battery packs only allow them to stay aloft for 20 minutes, while helicopters can stay in the air for hours at a time. And FAA regulations require that drone operators on the ground must maintain visual contact with the unmanned aircraft.Drones, Waite points out, would have been ill-equipped to cover what is perhaps the most famous aerial-footage story ever \u2014 1994's two-hour police pursuit of football star-turned-murder suspect O.J. Simpson's white Ford Bronco on the Los Angeles-area freeway system. News copters were able to transmit live video of the chase, and it aired nonstop on TV viewers' screens.That's why there probably will be room for both copters and drones in journalism for the foreseeable future. Some news organizations, such as Jacksonville, Florida-based TV station WJXT, rely on both.\"We use our Sky4 helicopter here in Jacksonville to cover breaking news and to get to a scene quickly,\" explains Bob Ellis, the station's vice-president and general manager, in an email. \"But drones often times provide far better pictures and can help tell a much better story. In our coverage after Hurricane Irma just last week we used drone footage to show damaged areas that showed exactly what happened far better than using a helicopter could.\"\"I believe there's a place for all these technologies to be utilized,\" he says. \"I prefer to look at it from a content standpoint, 'What is the technology that helps best tell the story?' That's how we look at here at my station.\"Perritt, the \"Domesticating Drones\" author, adds: \"Drones won't ever completely replace news helicopters. Because they are so much cheaper, they will be used in some markets instead of helicopters, and stations in big markets may renegotiate their helicopter contracts over time to use less helicopter time, filling the gap with drones.\"In the future, news organizations may use drones not just to capture dramatic aerial images, but to gather vast amounts of data from various angles to create virtual-reality simulations. Eventually, for example, news consumers may be able to put on a VR headset and walk through a three-dimensional simulation of the ruins of a war-torn city on the other side of the planet."},

Henry thought so, too.A famous designer, William B. Stout, had kindled the interest of both Ford and his son Edsel in aviation in 1924. Stout had built a series of all-metal airplanes culminating in the ungainly Model 3-AT before the almost inevitable falling out with Ford. Ford replaced Stout with Harold Hicks and Tom Towle, who, with other engineers including Otto Koppen, refined the design to produce first the Model 4-AT classic airplane, then the definitive 5-AT, the immortal \"Tin Goose\" Tri-Motor.Similar in appearance to the popular Fokker transports of the time, the Tin Goose had two great advantages: the Ford name and all-metal construction. Over the years, 199 Ford Tri-Motors airplanes would be built, and they would serve all three branches of the U.S. military, many airlines, many corporations, and 20 foreign countries. Strong, reliable, and surprisingly maneuverable, the Ford Tri-Motor inaugurated transcontinental airline service in the United while flying for Transcontinental Air Transport.Distinguished by the corrugated aluminum skin covering, the Ford could carry ten to twelve passengers on fairly comfortable wicker seats at a cruise speed of 110 to 115 miles per hour amidst deafening noise from the engines.The Tri-Motor could carry heavy, bulky loads and operate out of small landing strips. It found work all around the world for many years.

Almost all the corn grown in the U.S. is genetically modified. "], "date": "Updated: Aug 19, 2020", "content": "People have been \"genetically modifying\" everything from food to dogs for centuries; but in the past, the only tool has been available was selective breeding. For example, if you wanted to create a breed of corn with resistance to a certain fungus, you would plant a plot of corn and see how individual plants did with the fungus. Then you would take seeds from the plants that did well, plant them, look at their performance against the fungus and so on over the years until you had created a strain of corn plant that had very high resistance to the fungus in question.In the same way, you can take chickens, analyze their eggs and find chickens with eggs that contain less cholesterol. Then you breed them to create a strain of low-cholesterol chickens. You can select on any detectable trait and breed members of the species that do well on that trait. Using selective breeding techniques, people have created everything from variegated roses to giant pumpkins to strains of wheat with twice the yield and very high disease tolerance. But it often took years to get the desired traits.AdvertisementThings went next level, however, with the advent of genetic engineering techniques, which allow scientists to insert specific genes into a plant or animal without having to go through the trial-and-error process of selective breeding. Genetic engineering is therefore extremely fast compared with selective breeding. With genetic engineering, you also can cross species very easily (for example, you can create a plant that produces human insulin). Any plant, microorganism, animal or other organism that has undergone genetic modification in a laboratory is considered a genetically modified organism (GMO).To create a GMO, scientists must first figure out what the gene is that controls a particular trait, such as pest or virus resistance. Then, they copy the organism's genetic information for that trait and insert it into the DNA of the organism they want to grow (like corn or apples). Lastly, they grow the organism, which will ideally possess all the desired characteristics it has been manipulated for.Why go to all the trouble? Genetic engineering is an exercise in efficiency, as it's used to improve crop harvests by outsmarting pests and plant viruses; decrease food-related waste by giving crops longer \"shelf lives\"; help make the food system more sustainable and improve production to meet the world's food supply demands. Genetic engineering also is designed to improve food safety and even enhance the nutritional value of foods.For example, there is a widely used herbicide called Roundup, made by the company Monsanto. Roundup kills any plant that it touches. Monsanto has genetically modified soybeans and other crop plants to create \"Roundup Ready\" strains that are not affected by Roundup. By planting Roundup Ready seeds, a farmer can control weeds by spraying Roundup right over the crop. The crop completely ignores the herbicide, but the weeds are eliminated. Roundup Ready seeds reduce production costs and increase yield, so food becomes less expensive. (There have been a number of lawsuits filed against Monsanto alleging the plaintiffs got cancer from repeatedly using Roundup, reported Business Insider. But there is a lot of debate on that. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the European Food Safety Authority and other national regulatory bodies say that glyphosate isn't linked to cancer to humans. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization says the chemical is \"probably\" carcinogenic.)Other scientists have inserted genes that produce a natural insecticide into corn plants to eliminate damage from corn borers, and a variety of anti-fungal genes can be inserted as well. Genetically modified apples were even created that resist browning, which ideally reduces food waste because many people assume browned apples are spoiled.For many years, U.S. consumers were unaware of the creation of foods using GMOs, although they have been available since the early 1990s. By 2018, 94 percent of soybean and 92 percent of corn grown in the U.S. was from GMOs, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Despite stringent government regulations and more than 2,000 scientific studies proclaiming the safety of GMOs, a lot of people are none too pleased. A common complaint is that consumers don't trust the ingredients used in the genetic modification process, as they are not considered \"natural.\" Plus, since most farm animals eat GMO corn, does that have ill effects for them and for people who eat meat?There has also been quite a fight over whether or not products containing GMOs should be labeled as such. One side says that since multiple studies have shown them to be as safe as their non-GMO counterparts (possibly more so), any labeling efforts would be a waste of time and money. The other side considers them to be unsafe and says consumers should know exactly what they're eating. To that end, the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard was signed into law in 2016, requiring labels on bioengineered foods (for human consumption) that contain more than 5 percent genetically modified material. Implementation dates range from 2020 to 2022, depending on the type of food and the size of the manufacturer (smaller groups have longer to put labels in place).People will be able to quickly ascertain whether a food contains GMOs thanks to a label that says either \"bioengineered\" or \"derived from bioengineering.\" Some types of food intended for human consumption are exempt from this labeling rule, including food served in restaurants, delis, food trucks, airplanes, trains and the like. Very small food manufacturers don't have to comply.Originally Published: Apr 1, 2000"},

In all but the steadiest hands, there's an unstable transition between one focused object and the next. But for most of us, our eyes -- the video cameras of our brain, if you will -- suffer no unstable transition as they move quickly over a scene. The world remains stable no matter how quickly or erratically we change our focus.Scientists have known about and even understood this phenomenon for decades. To achieve a stable view despite quick eye movements, the eyes do an amazing thing: They take before and after shots of every focused image and compare them in order to confirm stability. That sounds a little complicated, but the process itself is pretty straightforward (and ingenious): Before your eyes actually sense an object, your brain takes its own picture of that object for comparison purposes. It knows where your eyes are going to move next, and it forms an image of the object that precedes our conscious, visual perception of it. Then, when our eyes do perceive that object in a sensory way (meaning we can see it), our brain has already laid the framework for a smooth transition. There's no shakiness and no instability. The brain has anticipated what our eyes are going to see, and it uses that anticipatory image for comparison to make sure the world has indeed remained stable in the split-second between the before shot and the after shot.AdvertisementSo the process is in the books. But scientists have spent at least 50 years trying to find out how the brain manages this feat. A study published in the online edition of the journal Nature offers insight into the mechanism that lets our brain see what our eyes are going to see before our eyes even see it. Scientists believe they have found a neural pathway that may explain the brain's anticipation of our eye movements. (Neurons are the message carriers in the brain. They form pathways that carry signals from one part of the brain to another.)Before we can understand exactly how this process works, we need to know a little about the various parts of the brain.

"], "date": "Jun 7, 2018", "content": "Imagine a comet hurtling through the nothingness of space. It smashes into a planet, causing destruction \u2014 but also bringing life. That's because hitching a ride on the surface of the comet were tiny traces of organic material or even alien eggs, explaining how life could spread across the cosmos and arrive on our planet. Panspermia (meaning 'seeds everywhere') is the name of the theory that life on Earth may have cosmic origins, and it's been both debated by scientists and featured in works of science fiction.Now, a group of nearly three dozen scientists from around the world are putting a tweak in the theory, suggesting not that Earth's earliest life has outer-space origins, but that panspermia may be responsible for the Cambrian explosion. That's a point in Earth's history approximately 541 million years ago when most major animal groups appear in the fossil record.AdvertisementIn the article \"Cause of Cambrian Explosion \u2014 Terrestrial or Cosmic?\" published in the August 2018 issue of the journal Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology, 33 scientists tie the rise of unique animals \u2014 tardigrades, octopuses, and the bevy of odd and unique animals that flourished at the time \u2014 to panspermia, suggesting that many of these relatively bizarre and never-before-seen creatures descend from organic alien material.\"It takes little imagination to consider that the pre-Cambrian mass extinction event(s) was correlated with the impact of a giant life-bearing comet (or comets), and the subsequent seeding of Earth with new cosmic-derived cellular organisms and viral genes,\" the authors write.For those getting excited that a number of reputable scientists have cracked the mystery of life's origins, it's not so simple. This new paper isn't built on any new discoveries or research; it's a literature review that for the most part references the authors' own existing work. But that's by design, the authors acknowledge.\"We are acutely aware that mainstream thinking on the origin and further evolution of life on Earth is anchored \ufb01rmly in the 'Terrestrial' paradigm,\" write the authors. \"Our aim here is to facilitate further discussion in the biophysical, biomedical and evolutionary science communities.\"Panspermia is at this point only a concept, but it dates back well before the last hundred years or so of modern science fiction. Way back at the turn of the 18th century, French diplomat and natural historian Benoit de Maillet proposed that life across the cosmos could have been \"seeded\" from space. And a few scholars even interpret ancient Greek philosopher Anaxagoras of Clazomenae's musings, who spoke vaguely of cosmic seeds 2,500 years ago, along the same lines.The paper has already drawn skepticism. Astrobiologist Frances Westall, for instance, points out that while some forms of extremophile life have been observed surviving the vacuum of space for short periods of time, this new paper's suppositions would require eggs, embryos or other cells survive thousands of years, if not more, in space.\"Unfortunately it is all too easy to pull information out of the literature to support one's hypothesis,\" Westall  told Newsweek when discussing the paper. \"Nature is incredible, and I do not think it is necessary to call on extraterrestrials to explain it.\"An alternate theory for the Cambrian explosion goes by the name Snowball Earth, and it suggests that 715 million years ago, our planet became encased in ice for 150 million years, killing most existing life forms, and that a massive thaw allowed for an explosion of biodiversity."},

While their efforts proved fruitless, the pseudoscience alchemy paved the way to the real science of chemistry. Through chemistry, we learned more about the world around us, including the fact that all matter is composed of atoms. The types of atoms and the way those atoms join together determines a substance's properties.Nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary science that looks at how we can manipulate matter at the molecular and atomic level. To do this, we must work on the nanoscale -- a scale so small that we can't see it with a light microscope. In fact, one nanometer is just one-billionth of a meter in size. Atoms are smaller still. It's difficult to quantify an atom's size -- they don't tend to hold a particular shape. But in general, a typical atom is about one-tenth of a nanometer in diameter.AdvertisementBut the nanoscale is where it's at. That's because it's the scale of molecules. By manipulating molecules, we can make all sorts of interesting materials. But like the alchemists of old, we wouldn't make much headway in creating gold. That's because gold is a basic element -- you can't break it down into a simpler form.We could make other interesting substances, though. By manipulating molecules to form in particular shapes, we can build materials with amazing properties. One example is a carbon nanotube. To create a carbon nanotube, you start with a sheet of graphite molecules, which you roll up into a tube. The orientation of the molecules determines the nanotube's properties. For example, you could end up with a conductor or a semiconductor. Rolled the right way, the carbon nanotube will be hundreds of times stronger than steel but only one-sixth the weight [source: NASA].That's just one aspect of nanotechnology. Another is that materials aren't the same at the nanoscale as they are at larger scales. Researchers with the United States Department of Energy discovered in 2005 that gold shines differently at the nanoscale than it does in bulk. They also noticed that materials possess different properties of magnetism and temperature at the nanoscale [source: U.S. Department of Energy].Because the science deals with the basic building blocks of matter, there are countless applications. Some seem almost mundane -- nanoparticles of zinc oxide in sunblock allow you to spread a transparent lotion on your skin and remain protected. Others sound like science fiction -- doctors are attempting to use the protein casings from viruses to deliver minute amounts of drugs to treat cancer.

The pipeline is 800 miles long and four feet in diameter. Sometimes it's above ground and sometimes below, and in the process, it crosses something like 800 rivers and streams.More than 1 million barrels of crude oil move through the pipeline each day. At 42 gallons per barrel, that means that the pipeline supplies about 6 percent of the oil used in the United States.AdvertisementYou can get some sense of what would happen if the pipeline blew up by looking at a microcosmic event that occurred in October 2001. A hunter, apparently inebriated, shot the Alaska pipeline with a hunting rifle and punctured it. A bullet would not make a very big hole -- maybe the size of a dime. Because of the pressure, however, 120 gallons of oil per minute sprayed out of the hole. Over the course of 36 hours, the pipeline was shut down and the oil had to be drained from the punctured section so that it could be repaired. But in that 36 hours, over 300,000 gallons of oil sprayed onto the trees and ground around the puncture, creating a massive spill.If someone were to blow up the pipeline, it would make the mess from a tiny bullet hole look like a pinprick. Assume that officials reacted quickly after the blast, shut down the pipeline, closed valves to block back-flowing oil, and had everything under control in 24 hours. Something like 40 million gallons of oil would be lying on the ground. That's enough oil to fill 40,000 swimming pools. Or enough to nearly fill an entire supertanker like the Exxon Valdez. Or enough to cover 100 acres of land in oil more than a foot deep.It would be even worse if the leak occurred near a river, because the oil would flow into the river and then downstream, destroying the river along the way.Simply speaking, it would be a real mess. It took more than $2 billion to clean up the 11 million gallons that leaked from the Exxon Valdez. The advantage of a spill at sea is that much of the oil stays at sea and never makes it to land. In the case of the pipeline, you would possibly have almost four times the oil all in one place -- and it would all be on land. The oil would run off to the local streams and rivers, just like rainwater does, destroying all the wildlife in its path."},

Also called Khufu's Pyramid, It's among the oldest, biggest human-made structures on Earth. Part of what makes it so wonderful is that, old as it is, it still holds mysteries. Built sometimes between 2509 to 2483 B.C.E. to entomb the remains of Egyptian pharaoh Khufu \u2014 also known as Cheops \u2014 the Great Pyramid was built to withstand millennia of harsh desert winds, but nobody really knows how it was built or exactly what its internal structure is like. But thanks to particle physics, we now know a little something more.New research published in the journal Nature suggests that the pyramid might hold a vast, previously unknown cavity, an empty space roughly as long as an airplane hangar. The exact dimensions aren't known, but how does a researcher find a chamber like this \u2014 what they're calling a \"void\" \u2014 when they're not exactly allowed to take sledgehammers to a 4,500-year-old structure?AdvertisementThe international research team used a technique called muon tomography \u2014 a particle physicist's version of an x-ray machine, which uses the high-energy cosmic rays that are constantly pelting Earth from deep space to visualize, say, what's behind a heavy limestone wall. These cosmic rays are mostly made up of hydrogen nuclei, but as they hit our atmosphere, they explode into smaller elementary particles. A byproduct of this process is the creation of negatively charged particles called muons, which, once they pop into existence, shoot towards the ground at unfathomable speeds. They can be slowed down by big, dense things, though \u2014 things like the Great Pyramid of Giza.In 2015, ScanPyramids, a project of Cairo University and the Heritage Innovation Preservation (HIP) Institute, set out to explore the innards of the largest pyramids in Egypt. Muons are predictably difficult to detect, but not impossible, and muon tomography works by seeking out muons as they pass through matter, powering down and decaying in the process. Because hitting something solid can accelerate muon death, the researchers looked for places in the pyramid where more muons were evident, suggesting the particles were falling through an empty space \u2014 or at least one made of less solid material.So, in Khufu's Pyramid, just above a cathedral-like hall called the Grand Gallery, the researchers found a significant amount of muons, using three different detectors, in three different experiments, meaning something is there \u2014 and that something is nothing.The research team hasn't offered up any theories about what purpose the space might originally have served.\"There are so many theories \u2014 nice ones but also crazy ones,\" coauthor Mehdi Tayoubi, president of the Heritage Innovation Preservation institute in Paris and co-founder of ScanPyramids told Nature News.But experts warn not to get too excited:\"There's zero chance of hidden burial chambers,\" University of Bristol Egyptologist Aidan Dodson, who was not part of the research team, told Nature.However, this research might be a good lead in gleaning more insights into how this incredible structure was built.In addition to the Khufu's Pyramid, the research team will turn their muon detectors on the two other major pyramids at Giza, as well as the iconic Sphinx."},

They obtain energy from the sun, although they can also be used in low light or cloudy applications. Portable solar chargers are used for trickle charging, meaning that low level current is fed continuously to the battery so that it maintains its charge, although some models can be used to completely recharge a car battery.Solar car chargers feature solar panels on the face. All you have to do is simply place it near a window or on top of your car's dashboard to absorb sunlight during the day. Some solar car battery chargers connect directly to the battery, while others feed power to the battery via the cigarette lighter/power socket.Car solar battery chargers are a relatively inexpensive way (popular models range from $20 to $95) to extend the life of your vehicle's battery. Since they rely on energy from the sun, there's no additional cost.In addition, using a car solar battery to maintain a charge can help give you peace of mind that your car battery will work when you need it.

In the 30 series, also known as the \"Apache\" line, Chevrolet continued to build the Cameo Carrier, which had been introduced in 1955.Though the Cameo had set truck styling history with its smooth, car-like lines, it cost a premium over other trucks and had never sold well. In February 1958, it was replaced by all-new Fleetside bodies, with \"jet-pod\" sculpturing along the cargo bed.The Fleetside brought a line-wide application of a styling technique the Cameo had pioneered: full-width rear bodywork, plus a chrome grille, bumpers, and trim. This was an important step for Chevrolet, since it made available Cameo-like styling at a moderate price. This precluded further production of the Cameo itself.AdvertisementAs a result, the 1958 is the rarest of all Chevrolet Cameos -- only 1,405 were built.

How do you figure out the length of the remaining side? That's easy, provided that you took geometry in high school and know the Pythagorean theorem, a mathematical statement that's thousands of years old.The Pythagorean theorem states that with a right-angled triangle, the sum of the squares of the two sides that form the right angle is equal to the square of the third, longer side, which is called the hypotenuse. As a result, you can determine the length of the hypotenuse with the equation a2 + b2 = c2, in which a and b represent the two sides of the right angle and c is the long side.AdvertisementA pretty slick trick, huh? But the man whom this math trick is named for is nearly as fascinating. Pythagoras, an ancient Greek thinker who was born on the island of Samos and lived from 570 to 490 B.C.E, was kind of a trippy character \u2014 equal parts philosopher, mathematician and mystical cult leader. In his lifetime, Pythagoras wasn't known as much for solving for the length of the hypotenuse as he was for his belief in reincarnation and adherence to an ascetic lifestyle that emphasized a strict vegetarian diet, adherence to religious rituals and plenty of self-discipline that he taught to his followers. Pythagoras biographer Christoph Riedweg describes him as a tall, handsome and charismatic figure, whose aura was enhanced by his eccentric attire \u2014 a white robe, trousers and a golden wreath on his head. Odd rumors swirled around him \u2014 that he could perform miracles, that he had a golden artificial leg concealed beneath his clothes and that he possessed the power to be in two places at one time.Pythagoras founded a school near what is now the port city of Crotone in southern Italy, which was named the Semicircle of Pythagoras. Followers, who were sworn to a code of secrecy, learned to contemplate numbers in a fashion similar to the Jewish mysticism of Kaballah. In Pythagoras' philosophy, each number had a divine meaning, and their combination revealed a greater truth.With a hyperbolic reputation like that, it's little wonder that Pythagoras was credited with devising one of the most famous theorems of all time, even though he wasn't actually the first to come up with the concept. Chinese and Babylonian mathematicians beat him to it by a millennium.\"What we have is evidence they knew the Pythagorean relationship through specific examples,\" writes G. Donald Allen, a math professor and director of the Center for Technology-Mediated Instruction in Mathematics at Texas A&M University, in an email. \"An entire Babylonian tablet was found that shows various triples of numbers that meet the condition: a2 + b2 = c2.\"AdvertisementThe Pythagorean theorem isn't just an intriguing mathematical exercise. It's utilized in a wide range of fields, from construction and manufacturing to navigation.As Allen explains, one of the classic uses of the Pythagorean theorem is in laying the foundations of buildings. \"You see, to make a rectangular foundation for, say, a temple, you need to make right angles. But how can you do that? By eyeballing it? This wouldn't work for a large structure. But, when you have the length and width, you can use the Pythagorean theorem to make a precise right angle to any precision.\"Beyond that, \"This theorem and those related to it have given us our entire system of measurement,\" Allen says. \"It allows pilots to navigate in windy skies, and ships to set their course. All GPS measurements are possible because of this theorem.\"In navigation, the Pythagorean theorem provides a ship's navigator with a way of calculating the distance to a point in the ocean that's, say, 300 miles north and 400 miles west (480 kilometers north and 640 kilometers west). It's also useful to cartographers, who use it to calculate the steepness of hills and mountains.\"This theorem is important in all of geometry, including solid geometry,\" Allen continues. \"It is also foundational in other branches of mathematics, much of physics, geology, all of mechanical and aeronautical engineering. Carpenters use it and so do machinists. When you have angles, and you need measurements, you need this theorem.\"One of the formative experiences in the life of Albert Einstein was writing his own mathematical proof of the Pythagorean theorem at age 12. Einstein's fascination with geometry eventually played a role in his development of the theories of special and general relativity."},

It's the rarest of mathematical constants, an unfailingly accurate ratio that's also neverending. The digits of Pi have been calculated out to more than 22 trillion decimal places without ever repeating (that's called an \"irrational number\").The definition of pi is simple: It's the ratio of a circle's circumference divided by its diameter. But what's remarkable is that no matter the size of the circle you are measuring, that ratio of circumference to diameter will always equal 3.1415926535897, usually shortened to 3.14. Divide the circumference of a tennis ball by its diameter and you get 3.14. Divide the circumference of the planet Mars by its diameter and you get 3.14. Divide the circumference of the known universe by its diameter \u2014 you get the point. As one mathematician put it, \"Pi is part of the nature of the circle. If the ratio was different, it wouldn't be a circle.\"AdvertisementThe following figure shows how the circumference of a circle with a diameter of 1.27 inches (32.35 millimeters) is equal to a linear distance of 4 inches (10.16 centimeters):As you might imagine, 4.0 (the circumference) / 1.27 (the diameter) = 3.14.Pi is critical to several basic calculations in geometry, physics and engineering, including the area of a circle (\u03c0r2) and the volume of a cylinder (\u03c0r2)h. When the ancient Babylonians attempted to measure the precise areas of circles back in 1900 B.C.E., they assigned a value to pi of 3.125. The ancient Egyptians came up with 3.1605. The Greek mathematician Archimedes (287-212 B.C.E.) and the Chinese mathematician Zu Chongzhi (429-501 C.E.) are co-credited with calculating the most accurate approximations of pi before calculus and supercomputers gave us the definitive answer [source: Exploratorium].In 1706, the self-taught Welsh mathematician William Jones assigned the Greek letter \u03c0 to this magical number without end, possibly because \u03c0 is the first letter of the Greek words for periphery and perimeter. The symbol's use was later popularized by 18th-century Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler but wasn't adopted worldwide until 1934.The fact that pi can be found everywhere \u2014 not only in circles, but in arcs, pendulums and interplanetary navigation \u2014 and that it's infinitely long has inspired a cult following that includes plenty of geeky tattoos and even its own national holiday.

If you make a lot of international phone calls, you might know that it's the country code for France.Chances are, though, that unless you're really, really into 33, you probably don't know that mathematicians have been trying to figure out for the past 64 years whether it's possible to come up with 33 as the sum of three cubes (as an equation, it's 33 = x\u00b3+ y\u00b3+ z\u00b3). (For a more sophisticated explanation, try this Quanta Magazine article.)AdvertisementIt's an example of something called a Diophantine equation, in which all the unknowns must be integers, or whole numbers. With some numbers, this sort of thing is pretty easy. As Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Bjorn Poonen explained in this 2008 paper, the number 29, for example, is the sum of the cubes of 3, 1 and 1. For 30, in contrast, the three cubes are all 10-digit numbers, and two of them are negative integers. Math is strange like that.Expressing 33 as the sum of three cubes has proven devilishly elusive. That is, until recently. A solution was worked out by Andrew Booker, who holds a doctorate in mathematics from Princeton and is a reader (a research-oriented faculty position) in pure mathematics at the University of Bristol in the UK.In this YouTube video from Numberphile, Booker explains that after he saw a video on the solving of the three cubes problem for 74, he got the inspiration to tackle 33:Ultimately, he devised a new, more efficient algorithm than mathematicians had been using up to this point.\"It probably looks like I've made things a lot more complicated,\" he explained in the video, as he wrote out calculations on a big brown sheet of paper.To crunch the numbers, he then used a cluster of powerful computers \u2014 512 central processing unit (CPU) cores at the same time \u2014 known as Blue Crystal Phase 3. When he returned to his office one morning after dropping his children off at school, he spotted the solution on his screen. \"I jumped for joy,\" he recalled.The three cubes are 8,866,128,975,287,5283; - 8,778,405,442,862,2393; and -2,736,111,468,807,0403.In the Numberphile video, Booker explains that he now intends to apply the same system to finding the three cubes that add up to 42, another number that's so far eluded solving. \"42 is the next 33,\" he jokes."},

Quite a lot according to a Aug. 20, 2018, paper published in the journal Current Biology \u2014 and it all comes down to how we think about causality.Creationists reject scientific explanations for life on Earth in favor of religious beliefs \u2013 beliefs that are inherently teleological. In other words, they attribute divine reason and purpose to the natural world. Meanwhile, scientists apply critical thinking to these same areas and seek not teleological but causative answers.Advertisement\"Teleology involves a bizarre way of thinking in reverse,\" neuropsychologist and study co-author Sebastian Dieguez explains. \"Teleology is the idea that the consequence of something is the cause of itself. And that if you see something, it was meant to be this way \u2014 so it is in a way its own cause.\"Examples of this include the \"everything happens for a reason\" explanation for human suffering, as well as childhood beliefs that a cat's purpose is to be petted or trees exist because humans need shelter. It's an oddly intuitive \u2014 but incorrect \u2014 way of seeing the world.Meanwhile, scientific reasoning strives to avoid this pitfall. Evolutionary theory provides a prime example.\"Evolution involves thinking in a very different way,\" says Dieguez. \"There is no reason for why things are as they are right now, no one decided this. It involves a slow process of gradual selection and adaptation. And it's pretty counterintuitive to think in this way.\"And so humans have to continually work against an ingrained impulse to think about the world teleologically. It's still a hindrance to the acceptance of evolutionary theory, at least at an individual level, and remains the backbone of religious thinking.This connection alone is nothing new, but the analysis published in Current Biology argues that fascination with conspiracy theories \u2014 or \"conspiracism\" \u2014 also is linked to teleological bias. A particular conspiracy theory might focus on UFOs or Bigfoot or the Illuminati, but they all share a common quality: an explanation of malevolent will for elements of sociohistorical events.AdvertisementDieguez and his colleagues looked at three separate studies, including a large-scale French survey (1,252 participants) and two smaller questionnaires (157 and 733 participants). In their answers, they found a strong correlation between creationism and conspiracism. After all, at the heart of each, is the idea that some form of conscious will dictates the unfolding of events.\"Conspiracy theories are kind of social creationism, because they involve seeing some new event in the world, say a terrorist attack or a natural disaster, and immediately explaining it by the final cause,\" Dieguez says. \"And the final cause of course is not god, but some kind of hidden individual or group of individuals \u2014 the conspirators.\"Now, as you're reading this, you might think, \"Well this doesn't apply to me. I only read about conspiracy theories for amusement. I only tune into 'Ancient Aliens' for a few laughs.\" But, as Dieguez points out, the underlying teleological framework of the ideas \u2013 no matter how ludicrous on the surface \u2013 might affect our abilities to think clearly. You certainly don't have to believe in order to engage their dangerous allure.\"In fact, the sample we used in the different studies, most of the people are not hard-core conspiracy theorists,\" Dieguez says. \"The level of agreement with conspiracy theories was actually pretty low. They don't really accept conspiracy theories as such; it's just that they are suspicious of the official story, they reject established knowledge, epistemic authorities \u2013 such as scientists and also journalists. And so they tend to prefer alternative beliefs, 'alternative facts' as they say, rather than official statements.\"As for the future, Dieguez says that a lot more work is required to flesh out the theoretical bones of conspiracism psychology, but that the more immediate front is educational. They're currently working in France to design and evaluate efforts to teach teenagers to exercise caution concerning conspiracy theories, fake news and misinformation.\"So we'll see what works, and what doesn't work to help improve trust in science and in the media, hopefully in a few years,\" Dieguez says.So think critically. Think skeptically. Apply the tenets of scientific reason against the forces of conspiracy theory, false news and misinformation.In the words of Carl Sagan, science is ever our \"candle in the dark.\"The connection between religious thinking and conspiracy theory makes perfect sense when you look to 20th-century examples like Satanic panic and alien abduction experiences \u2014 the latter of which may have helped fill the need for purpose-driven magic in an individual's life. In his 1995 book \"The Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark,\" Carl Sagan wrote \"in an age when traditional religions have been under withering fire from science, is it not natural to wrap up the old gods and demons in scientific raiment and call them aliens?\""},

"], "date": "Apr 11, 2019", "content": "Have you ever wondered exactly what happens to the human body when it's suspended in space for an extended period of time? Based on Hollywood productions alone, men and women who navigate the galaxy always seem to be just fine by the time they land back on Earth, but are astronauts so lucky in reality? NASA made it its mission to find out, and the results may surprise you.In a new landmark DNA study just published in the April 12, 2019 issue of the journal Science, researchers from John Hopkins, Stanford and other institutions reveal that after a year in space, astronaut Scott Kelly experienced no major, long-term differences to his epigenome (a.k.a. the record of chemical changes to DNA) compared to that of his twin brother, Arizona Senate candidate Mark Kelly, who stayed firmly planted on Earth. (Mark is the husband of former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords who was shot point blank during a constituent meeting held outdoors in Casas Adobes, Arizona.)While the scientists behind the study say the implications of their work aren't entirely clear yet, it appears additional research on the genomes of astronauts in space could help predict what kinds of unique health issues they may be at risk for.\"The Twins Study has been an important step toward understanding epigenetics and gene expression in human spaceflight,\" J.D. Polk, DO, chief health and medical officer, NASA headquarters, said in a statement. \"This has helped inform the need for personalized medicine and its role in keeping astronauts healthy during deep space exploration, as NASA goes forward to the Moon and journeys onward to Mars.\"AdvertisementHere's the deal with putting your body in space: It exposes you to harmful ultraviolet rays, radiation, limited food and exercise, lower gravity, disrupted sleep cycles and an unknown number of other potential hazards. And while scientists have spent decades studying the effects of space travel on astronauts, most of these men and women have traveled on missions that max out at six months. In order to travel somewhere, like say, Mars, missions need to be much longer, and scientists say it's critical to understand the effects these super-extended missions have on the human body.\"This is the dawn of human genomics in space,\" Andrew Feinberg, M.D., the Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of Medicine, Biomedical Engineering and Mental Health at Johns Hopkins University said in a statement. \"We developed the methods for doing these types of human genomic studies, and we should be doing more research to draw conclusions about what happens to humans in space.\"When scientists talk about epigenetics changes, they're referring to chemical DNA tweaks. These tiny alterations may have a major impact on a person's health by influencing the way genes are expressed, but they don't affect the genetic code itself. Potential problems pop up when epigenetic changes happen at the wrong time or place and in turn cause certain genes to turn on or off at the inappropriate time and place.A major advantage of this new research is the fact that it studies identical twins who naturally have identical genetic material. But while the study subjects offer a rare and unique glimpse into the potential for long-term genetic changes in space, the researchers are quick to admit the tiny sample size means more testing is essential. \"Since we only have two people in our study, we can't say that these changes are due to space travel itself,\" Feinberg said. \"We need more studies of astronauts to draw such conclusions.\"AdvertisementThe methodology for the study involved collecting blood samples, physiological data and cognitive measurements from each Kelly twin at various points over a 27-month period, before, during and after Scott's one-year space mission. If you're wondering how in the world (or universe) Scott's samples reached the scientists from space, they were transported via a rocket (yes, seriously).In the future, scientists hope to process and store samples onboard the International Space Station itself, but for the purposes of this study, samples were rocketed back to Earth and processed within 48 hours. Then Feinberg and his team examined the brothers' genomes, looking for epigenetic changes, specifically focusing on two types of white blood cells and examining a process called methylation, which occurs when chemical changes called methyl groups are added onto the DNA.Generally speaking, there were just about as many epigenetic changes in Scott as there were in his twin. The biggest difference was observed nine months into Scott's space mission when 79 percent of his DNA was methylated (when methyl is added to DNA), compared to 83 percent of Mark's DNA. The locations of methylation were different in both men; Scott's methylation appeared near genes in immune system response, which researchers believe correlates with additional data that found Scott had increased markers associated with inflammation.\"It was encouraging to see that there was no massive disruption of the epigenome in either Mark or Scott,\" former postdoctoral student/current senior scientist at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, Lindsay Rizzardi, said in a statement. \"However, with only two people in the study, we're limited in the conclusions we can draw about the effect of space travel on the genome. But the findings give us clues to what we should examine more closely in future studies of astronauts.\"One other weird thing happened to Scott in space: The shape of one of his eyeballs changed. By the time he got back to Earth, his retinal nerve and the folds in the choroid layer that surround the eye were thicker. These kinds of changes have been observed in other male astronauts before, but not females."},

But that's not exactly correct.\"Asphalt is the liquid that is in the road,\" says J. Richard Willis, Ph.D., vice president for engineering, research and technology at the National Asphalt Pavement Association (NAPA), who has a doctorate in asphalt design and construction. \"It's the binding agent that kind of holds the rocks together.\" Asphalt comes from crude oil, while tar comes from coal.Asphalt also is found naturally in the earth, and there are lakes of it where oil from underground has risen to the surface, like the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles and Pitch Lake in Trinidad, which is the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world.But the most common way the binder is made today is through the oil refining process. Asphalt is the heaviest of materials in a barrel of oil; it's basically the waste product.\"Asphalt is the heavy residue that settles to the bottom,\" Willis says. It cannot be used for energy, so it takes on new life as the sticky stuff that holds materials together. Combined with various amounts and types of rocks and other substances, it eventually becomes the mixture we drive on. The road is really an asphalt mixture or better termed \"asphalt pavement.\"AdvertisementAll the talk of oil refining may make asphalt sound like a relatively modern invention, but the first recorded use of asphalt in a road was in Babylon in 615 B.C.E.; asphalt and burned brick were used to pave a procession street during the reign of King Nabopolassar, according to the NAPA. The Romans used it to seal structures like baths and aqueducts. When English explorer Sir Walter Raleigh turned up at Pitch Lake in Trinidad in 1595, he used the asphalt for caulking his ships.\"It's been used in other non-road functions throughout history,\" Willis says. Using it as a binder in roads became more common in the 1800s. John Loudon McAdam, who built the Scottish turnpike, added hot tar to reduce dust and maintenance on roads. This method also improved driving conditions.In the United States, bituminous mixtures (asphalt concrete) first appeared in the 1860s, and the first \"true asphalt pavement\" was laid in Newark in 1870 by Edmund J. DeSmedt, a Belgian, according to NAPA. It was modeled after a natural pavement highway in France. DeSmedt then paved Washington, D.C.'s Pennsylvania Avenue with asphalt from Trinidad, further proving its durability.Enterprising chemists and inventors soon filed patents for different blends of asphalt mixtures, which appeared under a variety of names. As the industry grew, cities began requiring warranties on workmanship and materials. Until the early 1900s, nearly all asphalt came from natural sources, but with the launch of the first modern asphalt facility in East Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1901 and the increase in automobiles, requests for better roads invigorated the asphalt industry. By 1907, natural asphalt production was overtaken by refined petroleum asphalt.\"People started demanding better modes of transportation,\" Willis explains. \"The roads where people started using the asphalt to keep the rocks together held up longer than the conventional dirt road that people were used to.\" Driving on a gravel road versus one that was paved offered a significantly different experience. Finally, the 1956 Federal-Aid Highway Act helped transform the roads in the United States still made of packed dirt and created the 48,876-mile (78,658-kilometer) Interstate System in the U.S.AdvertisementAlthough it's most often associated with roads, asphalt is used for many purposes, though roads account for its most extensive use. Of the more than 2.7 million miles (4.3 million kilometers) of paved roads in the U.S., 94 percent are surfaced with asphalt, according to NAPA.Interestingly, though, all of that includes a mixture of about 95 percent stone, sand and gravel, and just 5 percent asphalt cement. Asphalt also is used for parking lots, airport runways and racetracks.\"Asphalt is a really flexible and versatile product,\" explains Willis. It can be used to line fishponds and water reservoirs or for sporting purposes like tennis courts. A couple of years ago, it was chosen as the base surface for the field at the Minnesota Vikings stadium in Minneapolis.Since the early days of asphalt production, the industry has continued to innovate new products, becoming more scientific and rigorous, according to Willis.\"We've changed the way we engineer the mixes,\" he says. \"We're at an era today where you are seeing a giant shift in how the industry and how states work.\" Using advanced testing methods, asphalt researchers have been aiming to improve performance. Incorporating new materials, additives and technologies, they are seeking to learn how various recipes will perform in different temperatures and climates.One major update has been the creation of warm-mix asphalt (WMA), which reduces the production temperature of asphalt at a plant, thereby reducing energy usage and saving time in both production and road surfacing. WMA also improves working conditions with lowered exposure to fuel emissions, fumes and odors, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration. WMA is technology that did not exist in U.S. in 2002 and now accounts for about 40 percent of the market, says Willis.AdvertisementAsphalt probably isn't something you think of as ecofriendly; it could be partly guilt by association because asphalt is naturally aligned with major polluters \u2014 driving automobiles and oil production. And some of the negativity is warranted: Because asphalt has low reflectivity, it has been determined to be a significant contributor to the urban heat island (UHI) effect, Abbas Mohajerani, Jason Bakaric and Tristan Jeffrey-Bailey wrote in a 2017 article in the \"Journal of Environmental Management.\" Anyone who has sat in a highway traffic jam on a hot summer day can attest to that.As far as asphalt's contributions to the UHI, the Environmental Protection Agency states that conventional asphalt pavements can be modified with materials or treated after installation to raise reflectance. For decades, this has been sometimes implemented on surfaces like parking lots and highways. The EPA includes porous asphalt and rubberized asphalt as examples of permeable pavements.Asphalt has also earned bad marks for being impermeable, for the gases it produces when melted and the fumes it exposes workers to during paving and roofing. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) says those fumes can lead to headache, skin rash, fatigue and even skin cancer. While OSHA's standards do not specifically address asphalt fumes, the administration recommends that controlling exposure can be done through \"engineering controls, administrative actions and personal protective equipment.\"And of course, there's still the fact that asphalt is made from petroleum. But asphalt does have positive eco-qualities too.Advertisement\"What a lot of people don't know is all of the environmentally friendly things the asphalt industry is actually doing,\" Willis says. For starters, asphalt is 100 percent recyclable, and more importantly, it actually does get recycled. In 2018, 82.2 million tons (74.5 million metric tons) of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) was put back into new mixes. That means every asphalt mix put down in the U.S. included about 21 percent RAP. In fact, the combined weight of all items people recycle annually in the U.S. \u2014 paper, plastic and aluminum \u2014 totaled a fraction of (about 68 percent) of the weight of RAP the asphalt industry recycles annually.\"That's just one material we recycle,\" says Willis. \"We are the most active recycling industry in the country.\" It is also one of the biggest recyclers of tire rubber, which is used as a modifier for mixtures in some states. Roof shingles also are recycled into new asphalt mixtures, and the industry is looking into how plastic might become part of the discussion. \"When people bring those questions to us, we try to find solutions.\"A lot of engineering and material science goes into constructing a road. Today, asphalt roads are designed around the concept of \"perpetual pavement,\" or at least to last 40 years or more. Routine maintenance consists of \"milling\" the surface \u2014 taking off the top inch or so \u2014 every 12 to 20 years and replacing it with a new overlay.

In the 1860s, a transcontinental railroad turned the months-long slog across America into a week-long journey. Just a few decades later, passenger automobiles made it possible to bounce across the countryside much faster than on horseback. And of course, during the World War I era, the first commercial flights began transforming our travels all over again, making coast-to-coast journeys a matter of hours. But rail trips in the U.S. aren't much faster today than they were a century ago. For engineers looking for the next big breakthrough, perhaps \"magical\" floating trains are just the ticket.In the 21st century there are a few countries using powerful electromagnets to develop high-speed trains, called maglev trains. These trains float over guideways using the basic principles of magnets to replace the old steel wheel and track trains. There's no rail friction to speak of, meaning these trains can hit speeds of hundreds of miles per hour.AdvertisementYet high speed is just one major benefit of maglev trains. Because the trains rarely (if ever) touch the track, there's far less noise and vibration than typical, earth-shaking trains. Less vibration and friction results in fewer mechanical breakdowns, meaning that maglev trains are less likely to encounter weather-related delays.The first patents for magnetic levitation (maglev) technologies were filed by French-born American engineer Emile Bachelet all the way back in the early 1910s. Even before that, in 1904, American professor and inventor Robert Goddard had written a paper outlining the idea of maglev levitation [source: Witschge]. It wasn't long before engineers began planning train systems based on this futuristic vision. Soon, they believed, passengers would board magnetically propelled cars and zip from place to place at high speed, and without many of the maintenance and safety concerns of traditional railroads.The big difference between a maglev train and a conventional train is that maglev trains do not have an engine \u2014 at least not the kind of engine used to pull typical train cars along steel tracks. The engine for maglev trains is rather inconspicuous. Instead of using fossil fuels, the magnetic field created by the electrified coils in the guideway walls and the track combine to propel the train.If you've ever played with magnets, you know that opposite poles attract and like poles repel each other. This is the basic principle behind electromagnetic propulsion. Electromagnets are similar to other magnets in that they attract metal objects, but the magnetic pull is temporary. You can easily create a small electromagnet yourself by connecting the ends of a copper wire to the positive and negative ends of an AA, C or D-cell battery. This creates a small magnetic field. If you disconnect either end of the wire from the battery, the magnetic field is taken away.The magnetic field created in this wire-and-battery experiment is the simple idea behind a maglev train rail system. There are three components to this system:We'll look at the track next."},

But there's one more tedious, but necessary step before you hang up those newly acquired clothing purchases \u2013 running them through the washing machine.It seems counterintuitive to wash new garments before wearing them. After all, they're brand-new and look clean. But there's a lot more going on behind the clothing scenes than most of us realize.Advertisement\"Many of our garments are made in countries that use formaldehyde and other chemicals to prevent damage from insects and mildew as they travel long distances to the U.S.,\" explains Mary Marlowe Leverette, laundry and housekeeping expert with The Spruce. \"These finishes and bacteria from other humans can be especially harmful to anyone with a compromised immune system, or young children who have not developed immunity to common bacteria.\"She notes that the chemical finishes are especially irritating to people with eczema, including atopic dermatitis. Currently, 31.6 million people in the United States alone have one or more types of eczema. For these people particularly, it's important to wash any excess dyes out of the fabric. People who are sensitive or allergic to azo-aniline dyes can wind up with a pretty serious skin reaction, which can be prevented altogether by prewashing.Chemicals aren't the only concern, however. Bacteria is capable of surviving on clothing, so they can transfer to your hands when you touch the clothes and then enter your body. Bacteria on clothing can also cause a skin infection if you have a scrape or open wound.Underwear are also more inclined to be contaminated by germs from feces or even genital infections. Although most people don't try on panties or boxers before purchase, swimsuits typically are donned by who knows how many people before they wind up in their forever homes (the stores do tell you to keep your underwear on when you try on a swimsuit but who knows how much this is followed). If that's not enough incentive, consider that scabies, lice and fungus are only too happy to jump onto a new host in the dressing room or at home.OK, you're convinced. So what's the best way to wash these new clothes? Tempting though it seems, resist the urge to run them through just a quick rinse cycle. \"A full wash is needed to remove most contaminates,\" Leverette explains. \"Use a heavy-duty laundry detergent with enough enzymes to break apart soils and the highest water temperature recommended for the type of fabric.\"After the initial wash, it's important to know how often you need to wash different types of clothes. Some items, like T-shirts, underwear and socks should be washed after every wear. Others, such as jeans, bras and pajamas can go longer between washes."},

You might have gotten to this point either by starting with logs in a fireplace or by starting with charcoal. If you now toss a piece of wood, or even a sheet of paper, onto this fire, what you will notice is that the new fuel produces a lot of smoke as it heats up. Then, all of a sudden (often with a small pop), it bursts into flame and the smoke disappears.If you have a fireplace or wood stove, or if you have been around a lot of campfires, this little scene is very familiar to you. It tells you a lot about smoke -- let's look at what is happening.AdvertisementThere are four things that you find in any piece of wood:When you put the fresh piece of wood or paper on a hot fire, the smoke you see is those volatile hydrocarbons evaporating from the wood. They start vaporizing at a temperature of about 300 degrees F (149 degrees Celsius). If the temperature gets high enough, these compounds burst into flame. Once they start burning, there is no smoke because the hydrocarbons are turned into carbon dioxide and water (both invisible) when they burn.This explains why you see no smoke from a charcoal fire (or a fire that has burned down to embers). Charcoal is created by heating wood to high temperatures in the absence of oxygen. That is, you take wood and put it in a sealed box of steel or clay and you heat it to about 1,000 degrees F (538 C). This process drives off all of the volatile organic compounds and leaves behind the carbon and the minerals (ash). When you light the charcoal, what is burning is the pure carbon. It combines with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, and what is left at the end of the fire is the ash -- the minerals.Coke from coal is the same thing. Coke is coal that has been heated in the absence of oxygen to drive off the organics. The smoke that this process produces is actually very valuable -- it contains coal tar, coal gas, alcohols, formaldehyde and ammonia, among other things. And all of these compounds can be distilled out of the smoke for use. You may have heard of methanol (a form of alcohol) referred to as \"wood alcohol.\" It used to be produced by distilling out of wood smoke."},

See more ", "."], "date": null, "content": "On July 12, 1966, a newcomer by the name of Bobby Allison won a NASCAR Grand National race at Oxford Plains Speedway in Oxford, Maine. The 28-year-old Allison outdueled Tiny Lund to win the 300-lapper on the 1/3-mile paved oval.The spectators in attendance cheered Allison's arrival, who drove a self-groomed Chevrolet. It was the first win for the Chevrolet nameplate in NASCAR's premier series since Dec. 1, 1963, when Wendell Scott won at Jacksonville, Fla. The drought had spanned 155 races.AdvertisementIn an era when General Motors cars were rendered noncompetitive in the face of the big-buck Ford and Chrysler factory efforts, Allison became a leader of the \"little guys\" and the unheralded \"bowtie brigade.\" The Hueytown, Ala., driver won three times in 1966, then started attracting offers from top-ranked teams. During his career, Allison won races for a dozen different team owners and drove eight different makes of cars into \u00advictory lane.A brilliant driver for more than two decades, Allison became one of NASCAR's most prolific race winners. During his career, which lasted until 1988, Allison won 85 races, third in all-time rankings. His greatest desire, however, was to win the elusive NASCAR Winston Cup Grand National championship.Allison came close on a number of occasions. In 1970, he finished second to Bobby Isaac in the final points standings. He might have won, but missing an early season race at Richmond left him with a deficit he was unable to overcome.While driving for Mario Rossi's factory-supported Dodge team, which entered only major events, Allison had to build his own short-track car to run the smaller 100-milers that made up the bulk of the 1970 season. The car wasn't complete by the Richmond race in March, so he was forced to forego the event. If Allison had competed at Richmond, he would have only had to finish 24th or better to win the championship.Allison won 10 races and 12 poles in 1972, but finished a close second to Richard Petty. Allison led virtually every \u00adcategory in '72. He had the most wins, won more poles than any other driver, led more than twice as many laps as any other driver, and led more races. He finished first or second in 22 of the 31 races. A season laced with excellence rewarded Allison with everything except that which he most wanted, the coveted driver's championship.Three other runner-up finishes in the championship standings in 1978, '81, and '82 were bitter pills to swallow, especially in '81 and '82. In both years, Allison had built up big points leads only to see Darrell Waltrip rally in the closing stages to snatch the title. \"I've come so close so many times,\" said a discouraged Allison in '82. \"Maybe I'm never going to win a Winston Cup championship.\"In 1983, while driving Buicks for the Charlotte-based DiGard Racing team, Allison again was a prime contender for NASCAR's highest honor. By May, Allison had climbed atop the standings and in a mirror image of the previous two seasons, he had a commanding lead by midsummer. But once again, Waltrip began his patented late-season charge and closed within 41 points heading into September.This time, Allison was up to the challenge. He clicked off three consecutive victories at Darlington, Richmond, and Dover. A brief stumble at Rockingham allowed Waltrip to get within striking distance, but in the final two events of 1983, Allison finished third and ninth to wrap up the title.\"I've worked hard for a long, long time,\" said Allison after locking up the championship. \"My wife Judy has worked with me, and so many people have supported me over the years. This is something I have wanted for my entire career and today I'm going to celebrate it. I just thank God for it.\"Allison won the Daytona 500 three times with three different team owners -- Bud Moore, DiGard, and the Stavola Brothers. His win in the 1988 Daytona 500 was the 85th and final victory of his career, an event in which he finished just ahead of his son Davey in a stirring finish.Later that year, Allison's driving career ended when he was seriously injured in an opening-lap crash at Pocono. A flat tire sent his Buick into a spin and Jocko Maggiacomo plowed into his driver's door. After a long recovery, Allison eventually returned to the NASCAR stage as a team owner.Bobby Allison remains one of the greatest drivers to ever strap on a racing helmet, not only in NASCAR, but in any racing series. The fans adored his warm smile, his amiable attitude and, most of all, his irrepressible spirit.Racing Career: 1961, 1965-1988Starts: 718Wins: 85 Top 5s: 336 Top 10s: 446 Poles: 59Career Winnings: $7,673,808"},

As you near the end of your untangling, unknotting task, you realize that there must be some way to keep your tie-downs organized -- but how?AdvertisementTie-down hangers may be the answer. Tow strap tie-down hangers are an excellent way to keep various tie-downs out of the way when they're not in use. When tie-down hangers are used properly, they can keep tie-down straps well organized, untangled and tightly secured against the wall of your trailer, garage or wherever they're installed.Tie-down hangers have a rather simple design. Most closely resemble a very small towel rack. Other designs look more like a piece of angle iron -- a flat piece of metal bent to form a 90 degree angle -- with holes drilled at measured intervals. Both designs are very effective, and they come in a variety of lengths to match your installation needs.Now that you've decided that tie-down hangers are likely the best way to get rid of your spaghettilike pile of straps, a few questions remain.

The country's deep past is also recorded in geology.In days gone by, settlers and explorers used our natural wonders as navigational tools. Now, these rock formations are popular vacation destinations. The Grand Canyon, for instance, attracted 6.3 million visitors in 2018 alone. During that same year, some 11,000 outdoor enthusiasts sought permits to climb Mount St. Helens in Washington state. We're drawn to such places because of the stunning views they offer, and the sense of awe they inspire.And knowing a little bit about how awesome landmarks like Nebraska's Chimney Rock or North Carolina's Pilot Mountain formed will only enhance your appreciation for them. To that end, we're throwing a salute to some of America's geological treasures.AdvertisementYou may recognize Chimney Rock from its appearances in the \"Oregon Trail\" computer games. A natural spire in Nebraska's panhandle, it greeted thousands of westbound travelers during the 18th century. The  realOregon Trail ran right past Chimney Rock, and so did the equally-historic Mormon and California trails.At present, Chimney Rock stands 325 feet (99 meters) tall. But it's slowly eroding away. This trailside marker is made up of geological strata that were deposited between 34 and 23 million years ago. Prehistoric volcanoes in Utah and Nevada used to emit huge clouds of ash that would settle on the great plains. There, the ash mixed with sands, clays and silts brought down from the Rocky Mountains by local waterways. The result? Brand-new layers of rock.Within the past 5 million years, water and wind carved these layers up. Erosion sculpted Chimney Rock out of the existing strata, along with Nebraska's famous Courthouse and Jailhouse Rocks. Slowly but surely, the same process is still whittling all three landmarks down. Don't worry, though. They're not likely to disappear anytime soon.AdvertisementThomas Jefferson's father, Peter, helped map this tree-topped beauty way back in 1751. Originally known as \"Jomeokee,\" which means \"great guide\" in the language of the Saura Native Americans, Pilot Mountain is a great example of a monadnock.Monadnocks are isolated hills, knob-like protuberances, or small mountains with steep sides. The terrain surrounding them is more or less flat and they rise sharply above it. Another name for monadnock is \"inselberg,\" which is German for \"island mountain.\"Well, Pilot Mountain certainly fits the bill. A member of North Carolina's Sauratown Mountain Range, its peak stands 1,400 feet (427 meters) above the mostly level countryside at its base. Pilot Mountain's summit is a rounded knob dubbed the \"Big Pinnacle.\" Some 200 feet (61 meters) in height, its walls are almost vertical. While the bulk of this mountain is covered in trees, those rocky walls are pretty much naked.Pilot Mountain is largely made up of hard quartzite, which is very resistant to erosion. Therein lies the secret to its longevity. Birders may be interested to know that Big Pinnacle is now a protected nesting area for ravens and turkey vultures.AdvertisementMore than 75 percent of all the world's active and dormant volcanoes are located in the Pacific \"Ring of Fire.\" A belt of volcanically active sites and earthquake-prone areas, it passes through New Zealand, the Indonesian Archipelago, the Philippines, Japan, Russia and the western coastlines of the Americas.The ring encompasses North America's Cascade Mountain Range. Stretching from California to British Columbia, the range is a byproduct of tectonic subduction. For millions of years, the Juan de Fuca oceanic plate in the northwestern Pacific has been getting pulled (or \"subducted\") underneath the more buoyant North American continental plate.On its way down, water trapped inside the oceanic plate gets released. Once freed, it produces magma: liquid and semi-liquid molten rock. This stuff can travel upward and erupt onto the Earth's surface as lava.The volcanoes in the Cascade Range were formed by a combination of erupting lava and magmas that accumulated below the surface. Mount St. Helens is particularly infamous. Located 96 miles (154 kilometers) south of Seattle in Washington state, it underwent a catastrophic eruption on May 18, 1980. The disaster claimed 57 lives and Mount St. Helens lost about 1 cubic mile (4.1 cubic kilometers) of rock in the process, severely lowering the volcanic mountain's peak.AdvertisementAbout 50,000 years ago, an asteroid measuring just 150 feet (46 meters) across smacked into the northern Arizona desert, some 40 miles (64 kilometers) east of where Flagstaff now sits. Striking the planet with the force of 2.5 tons (2.26 metric tons) of TNT, it left behind an otherworldly crater.At 570 feet (173 meters) deep and 4,100 feet (1,250 meters) wide, Barringer Crater is a sight to behold. Geologists think the violent impact from the asteroid displaced about 175 million tons (159 million metric tons) of southwestern rock.We know the asteroid itself mainly consisted of an iron-nickel alloy. Mathematical models suggest that it fractured into pieces before striking Earth. An especially large hunk probably hit Earth at the incredible speed of 7.45 miles per second (12 kilometers per second).Barringer Crater is also known simply as \"Meteor Crater.\" Yet its true identity wasn't always obvious. Scientists used to think the great pit was formed by volcanic activity. However, in 1903, geologist Daniel Barringer correctly surmised that it was an impact crater left behind by some extraterrestrial object. By the early 1960s, this had become the scientific consensus.AdvertisementA whole lot of history is written on the Grand Canyon's breathtaking walls. The oldest material, exposed near the bottom of the Upper Granite Gorge (and some other areas), resides in a layer called the Vishnu Basement Rock. Approximately 1.84 to 1.66 billion years old, this layer includes granites, schists and gneiss. Some Vishnu Basement Rock deposits were radically transformed when the North American continent collided with volcanic island chains.Meanwhile, one of the youngest strata is the Kaibab Limestone, which hugs the canyon's rims in several places. According to the National Park Service, it was laid down a scant 270 million years ago \u2014 shortly before the biggest mass extinction event that our world's ever seen.Of course, extinctions can't happen on a lifeless planet. And the Grand Canyon is jam-packed with a diverse collection of fossils, representing all kinds of different organisms like trilobites, ammonites and ancient plants \u2014 to name a few.Nobody knows when the canyon itself formed. Some researchers think it may have emerged in phases, with the Colorado River linking a series of smaller, variously aged canyons together into the 227-mile (446-kilometer) natural wonder that now graces Arizona. Proponents of this (rather controversial) hypothesis say the big merger could've been completed as recently as 5 to 6 million years ago.Mount St. Helens isn't the tallest volcano in the Cascade Range; that honor belongs to Mount Rainier.

Hour of Code (offered by the nonprofit Code.org) gives children a peek into the world of coding through easy, fun coding tasks, which expose them to the problem-solving skills and limitless potential of computer programming. Activities are designed to be completed within an hour, though, of course, a student can go on to perform multiple tasks.AdvertisementThe first Hour of Code event happened during Computer Science Education Week in December 2013, the brainchild of Iranian-American brothers Hadi Partovi and Ali Partovi, who decided that someone needed to do more to spark interest in coding.The initial event was a massive success, engaging roughly 20 million people who wrote hundreds of millions of lines of code. It was soon followed by a now-famous YouTube video featuring some of the biggest names in tech, who shared that their own early forays into programming were simple tasks, like creating shapes or questionnaires.Now, anyone can organize an Hour of Code event, which takes place the second week of each December. The curriculum and associated resources are totally free, tutorials are available in 20 languages, and some can be done even without a computer, smartphone or other device. Anyone from kindergarteners to adults can participate, and events can even be planned outside of this time frame.Hour of Code promoters don't claim that a few hours of coding will turn anyone into a computer scientist. But they do think that it's beneficial to society as a whole when the inner workings of computers are demystified, and when young people have a better grasp of creative problem solving.To find Hour of Code activities in your state or country, go to Hour of Code. Or you can simply use the free tutorials.Although the computer industry is dominated by males, the first computer programmer was a 19th-century British mathematician named Ada Lovelace. She created an algorithm that's been described as the world's first computer code. Another pioneering female programmer, Admiral Grace Murray Hopper, has a birthday on Dec. 9.

Hybrid engines combine two different sources of power to move the vehicle. The first source is the traditional internal combustion engine, which produces power by burning fuel, usually gasoline. The second source is usually an electric motor that gets its power from a battery pack within the vehicle. The engine and the electric motor work together to produce the power the vehicle needs to operate. However, the internal combustion engine in a hybrid car is typically much smaller than usual for efficiency and to accommodate the electric motor. This dichotomy raises a big question for green driving enthusiasts wanting to combine engine performance and fuel economy: How can a hybrid engine create more power?AdvertisementOne way to boost hybrid power is to update the batteries. For instance, the battery pack used in the third-generation Toyota Prius is smaller and more efficient [source: Garrett] than those in previous versions of the car, which gives it a slightly higher power output [Source: Voelcker]. The second generation's battery pack was rated for 28 horsepower, compared to the third generation's 36 horsepower [source: Toyota]. Although it's only a slight power improvement over earlier generations, battery technology is moving towards lithium-ion batteries that can potentially produce even more power in the near future.These new batteries have plenty of upside: Lithium-ion batteries can produce more power in the same amount of space, because lithium has a greater energy density than the nickel metal hydride batteries used in most hybrids -- and it weighs less as well. Due to these advantages, you may start to see lithium-ion batteries used in hybrid vehicles relatively soon.In addition to installing more powerful batteries, the electric motors can increase their power by upping the voltage. The 2010 Prius increases its power from a 500-volt system in the previous version, to 650 volts in the redesigned model [Source: Toyota].It's easy to see that an increase in electric motor power, combined with a powerful combustion engine, is just the recipe needed to create a hybrid that can rival traditional vehicles.Go on to the next page to see how hybrids can attain serious horsepower output while managing to keep their fuel efficiency up."},

But the logistics can get pretty complicated. There are a lot of decisions to make from the beginning. Where should you buy? If you purchase a house in an up-and-coming neighborhood, you're banking on the neighborhood increasing in value. If you decide to buy in a new development, you'll want to attract higher-end home buyers who want the luxury features and space offered in the suburbs. If all goes well, you could make a nice profit. But if something goes wrong -- faulty budgeting, timing issues, a crime spike in that up-and-coming neighborhood -- you could be stuck with a house you can't get rid of.So much in house-flipping depends on the real-estate market, which we all know is cyclical. During a boom, flippers have the upper hand and can almost name their price in some areas. But during a slow period, many of these fixed-up homes can sit on the market for months.Advertisement\u00adOnce you know where you want to buy, the next step is deciding what type of property you want to purchase. If you go for a fixer-upper, you're committing to improving the home, which takes time and money. If you buy a foreclosed property in an auction or from a bank, you could get a bargain on a vastly underpriced house. But remember that if the previous owners couldn't pay the mortgage, they probably couldn't pay for the upkeep, either -- so you might have to deal with a rodent infestation or a leaky roof.Fixer-uppers and foreclosures are what most people think of when flipping comes to mind. But it is possible to flip a house without doing any work on it at all. During the real-estate boom of the early to mid-2000s, flippers could buy new construction homes, hold on to them for a few months, then sell them at a profit. Now there's a trend toward trying to flip houses in new, high-end developments in outlying suburbs. If commercial and retail development (read: big-box superstores) spring up, it could bring in droves of residents. But if the situation isn't perfect -- if gas prices rise, for example, causing home buyers to shy away from big commutes -- this kind of flipping becomes pretty risky.So why do people flip houses? And what does the average buyer -- and seller -- need to know about flipping before investing? How much money can be made by flipping a house? And what kind of moral line do you walk by paying bottom dollar to people who have lost their homes? We'll address all of these issues as we investigate the art of house flipping."},

Does syncing lights mean that traffic will always keep flowing? "], "date": "Oct 24, 2018", "content": "In 2013, Los Angeles completed a 30-year, $400 million project to synchronize 4,500 traffic lights across the city's 469 square miles (1,215 square kilometers). By deploying a vast network of magnetic sensors installed under roadways plus hundreds of cameras, the city could now capture real-time traffic data using a centralized computer system to synchronize green lights in order to reduce LA's notorious congestion and rush-hour gridlock.Soon after the Los Angeles system was completed, city engineers cheerfully reported that the average speed of traffic was up 16 percent, and that the time it took to drive 5 miles (8 kilometers) on LA city streets was down from 20 minutes to 17.2 minutes. And yet, in 2018 LA still held the No. 1 spot for most traffic-congested city in the U.S.So why didn't syncing the lights make more of a dent in the congestion problem? Tim Lomax is a research fellow with the Texas A&M Transportation Institute and a 35-year veteran of traffic analysis. He says that adaptive traffic signals are absolutely a good thing, but they are not the quick-fix panacea that frustrated commuters believe them to be.Synced traffic signals work best when there is a clear and predictable flow of traffic in one direction, explains Lomax. Think of the traditional commuter scenario in which traffic flows primarily from the suburbs into the city center in the morning, and reverses course in the evening.\"If you tell me that's the pattern of traffic flow, I can design a pretty well-functioning traffic signal system,\" says Lomax, because it's clear which side of the road should get longer green lights, and those lights can be timed with the flow of traffic to keep cars moving. The problem is that traffic patterns in the biggest U.S. cities aren't so cut and dried.\"If you look at the economic landscape now, there are jobs and populations spread all over most metropolitan areas, and the highest volume of commuting could be from one suburb to another suburb,\" says Lomax. \"All of your critical bottleneck intersections have heavy traffic coming at them in both directions.\"AdvertisementCalifornia's City of Irvine explains the process like this: The city's traffic control center calculates the arrival time for a group of cars at each intersection, assuming the cars are traveling at a certain speed and then times the traffic signal to turn green just as this group hits the intersection. More \"green time\" is given to a main street with greater traffic volume than a side street with less volume.Synchronized traffic lights don't mean that a driver will encounter an unending number of green lights as she drives down a major road. What it means is that all the signals on a main road are set to run the same cycle length (the time the signal goes from green to yellow to red to green) after the side street has been serviced. Ideally, the signal would turn green again as the next group of cars arrives. LA's traffic system overhaul went further than most others, by using cameras and sensors to measure traffic flow and make real-time adjustments to keep traffic moving.Lomax says that poorly timed traffic signals can cause significant delays, and that cities can make big gains by updating signal timing every three years to adjust for new traffic patterns.\"If you start off with a poorly timed signal in an area that's growing and upgrade to a better-timed system that works pretty well, you can probably get rid of half the delay and in some cases maybe more,\" says Lomax, defining \"delay\" as the difference between travel times during low-traffic and peak traffic conditions.AdvertisementBut retiming traffic lights costs money and manpower. According to Texas A&M research, cities should expect to spend between $3,500 and $4,000 per intersection and devote 20 to 30 man hours for analyzing and retiming each signal. And jurisdiction issues can complicate matters when the same stretch of road passes through different municipalities. What if one city or suburb doesn't want to fork over money for the upgrade? That can hold up a retiming effort for years.A TV news report noted that the last time traffic lights were all synced in Atlanta (another city with major traffic congestion) was in the mid-1970s when Atlanta had traffic lights at 320 intersections. In 2011, it had lights at a further 945 intersections that were not included in the coordination system.Retiming or syncing traffic lights is only one tool in the traffic-fighting toolbox. Lomax says that another effective strategy is to clear away accidents and disabled cars more quickly. He says that commuters aren't as miffed by long drive times as they are by unpredictable drive times. What really stresses people out is when the daily 45-minute commute unexpectedly becomes an hour-and-a-half commute. And the most common causes of unexpected delays are accidents and stalled cars.And here is one more reason why synchronized traffic lights may not help with traffic flow as much as we'd like: Once people realize that congestion has improved on a street, it encourages them to get in their cars and drive on it, thereby increasing the number of cars on the road \u2014 which means more traffic.According to a 2018 report by INRIX, a global company that analyzes traffic patterns, the worst cities for traffic congestion in the U.S. were Los Angeles, followed by New York City, San Francisco, Atlanta and Miami."},

Maddening, yes. Entrapment, no. "], "date": "Aug 21, 2018", "content": "Here's the basic scenario that probably puts a chill down any driver's spine. You're cruising down some unfamiliar stretch of highway and you're not paying too much attention to your speedometer. The second after you pass a billboard, you notice that a police car is parked behind it, and the officer happens to have a radar gun pointed at you. The next thing you know, you're being waved over and instructed to provide your driver's license and vehicle registration. A few long minutes later, you drive off with an expensive speeding ticket tucked in your glove compartment.Getting caught in a speed trap \u2014 loosely defined as a spot where law enforcement officers are lying in wait to catch and ticket drivers exceeding the limit \u2014 can be a frustrating experience. And it's probably not that uncommon. Getting pulled over for speeding is something that happens to nearly one in ten motorists each year, according to a survey released in 2013 by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Those who were stopped say they received tickets 68 percent of the time, while 27 percent managed to get away with just a warning (another 5 percent didn't get either). And depending upon the location, those who get cited can feel some serious financial pain. In New York state, for example, a speeding ticket could end up costing you more than $1,000, according to the Governor's Traffic Safety Committee.AdvertisementYou might be thinking that this all seems unfair, and possibly illegal. How come police are able to conceal themselves and wait for unsuspecting speeders to fall into their snare? Isn't setting a speed trap a form of entrapment? After all, the two terms sound so similar.Sorry to disappoint you, but don't ever try that argument in traffic court.\"A speed trap is not entrapment because an officer is not inviting, enticing nor encouraging a driver to commit the offense of speeding,\" explains Valdosta, Georgia-based attorney William Long Whitesell in an email. As Whitesell details further in this 2017 blog post, the police don't have any legal obligation to tell motorists where they are, and it's perfectly okay for them to conceal their presence in an effort to catch violators. To commit entrapment, they'd have to do something really outrageous \u2014 such as pull up alongside you in an unmarked vehicle, ask how fast your sports car can go and then challenge you to a race. (That's just a hypothetical example, Whitesell says.)And that's not just true in Georgia. Other states use the same definition of entrapment. Pennsylvania judge Jessica Brewbaker offers a similar explanation of what entrapment actually means in this 2014 PennLive.com column.While nobody likes to get stopped for speeding, it's not hard to understand the importance of enforcing speed limits. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, speeding was a factor in 27 percent of all fatal crashes in 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, and those accidents cost more than 10,000 people their lives.That said, speed traps also have come under scrutiny in some places, where small towns have been accused of relying upon them as a money maker rather than to save lives. Garry Biller, president of the National Motorists Association, a Waunakee, Wisconsin-based advocacy group, explains that for decades, the convention in traffic engineering has been that speed limits should follow the 85th percentile rule. That means that the legal limit should be just a few miles per hour over the average speed of traffic on that particular stretch of road, which research has shown is the safest speed for drivers.But that number isn't necessarily permanent, since traffic flow can evolve over time. If there hasn't been a recent traffic study, a situation can develop in which the posted speed limit actually is slower than the prevailing flow of traffic.\"When we find those in locations where there seems to be heavier law enforcement, that leads us to believe that the enforcement is more revenue-based,\" Biller says.It's hard to say exactly how any speed traps exist. In an effort to alert drivers to their presence, NMA has compiled a database of more than 80,000 user-submitted possible locations for speed traps in the U.S. and Canada. There also are some notorious historical examples, such as the small Florida towns of Lawtey and Waldo, where police used to write so many speeding tickets that in 1995, AAA officially designated both as \"Traffic Traps\" and even erected signs outside them to warn unwary drivers to slow down. (According to the Gainesville Sun and this AAA press release, the towns eventually changed their ways, and in 2018, AAA officially removed the designation.)In recent years, some states have sought to discourage towns from operating speed traps by passing laws that limit the percentage of revenue that a town can derive from traffic tickets, according to this 2017 report from the National Conference of State Legislatures. Florida, for example, passed legislation in 2015 that requires a municipality or county to submit a report to a legislative auditing committee if total revenue from citations pays more than a third of a local law enforcement agency's annual expenses. Georgia has a law that presumes that speed detection devices are being used for improper purposes if the resulting fines cover 40 percent or more of the agency's budget. New York, Oklahoma and Texas have passed similar laws. Another state, Missouri, passed a law in 2015 requiring that all citation revenue exceeding 10 percent of operating expenses be turned over to the state to fund schools.In 1901, Connecticut passed the nation's first speed limit for motor vehicles, which was set at 12 miles per hour (19 kilometers per hour), according to Connecticuthistory.org.

Condos can be apartment-style, townhouse style, or even several small houses. A townhouse isn't necessarily a condo, though.\"Here's the important difference: Townhouse owners own the little patch of land their townhouse sits on.

While a flawless, FaceTuned selfie isn't necessarily the goal (unless you're into that sort of thing), most of us could benefit from a few foolproof tips for highlighting our best assets. We asked a couple of photography pros to reveal the secrets to showcasing a Tyra-worthy smize and feeling super confident in front of the lens.AdvertisementThe first things so many of us do when we're caught staring down the barrel of a camera or phone is to either freeze up or spring into an animated re-creation of the Hadid sisters' greatest poses. According to experts, neither of those tactics bodes well for anyone who doesn't have a Victoria's Secret or Gucci contract to their name.\"People try too hard to make themselves look like some high-fashion model,\" says San Francisco Bay area-based photographer, Gabe Ruvinsky. \"There's no need. Just be yourself and let the photographer shoot.\"San Francisco photographer and designer Daniela Velasquez-Mora agrees. \"In my opinion I think the biggest mistake is over-posing,\" she says. \"Looking natural and relaxed is more flattering!\"So when you spot a camera coming for you, take a deep breath, remember to exhale, and trust that if you loosen up and resist the urge to emulate a fashion icon, you're probably much better off.AdvertisementBut don't be weird about it. Often one of the most jarring parts of assessing photos can be the realization that your posture sucks. While it's important to realize we all should have listened when our mothers scolded us for slumping over in teen angst, the best thing we can do for the sake of future photos is take proper measures to correct our curved spines and shrugged shoulders.\"Engage your abs, roll your shoulder down and do you!\" Velasquez-Mora says. That means taking heed of tip one and shaking out any tension that creeped into your muscles the second the camera came out. \"One of my favorites is adding movement!\" Velasquez-Mora adds. \"Walk, tuck your hair, adjust an accessory. Little gestures add a very dynamic feel and best of all come across as natural.\"Another route to improving an imperfect stance is to put in some prep work ahead of time. \"If you have really bad posture, stand in front of a mirror and practice,\" Ruvinsky says. \"But if worst comes to worst, sitting down isn't a half-bad plan B.\" Just make sure to sit up straight, like mom told you.AdvertisementAny loyal \"Friends\" fans will fondly remember Chandler Bing's distinct inability to smile on cue. Judging by the astounding amount of awkward family photos circulating the internet, Chandler isn't the only one who struggles to let his natural good humor shine through. So what's the key to not looking like a serial killer when the camera comes out?\"Laugh! Literally laugh!\" Velasquez-Mora says. \"Forget about the camera and people watch or find something humorous about the moment or location.\"If the surrounding environment leaves something to be desired as far as inspiration goes, call upon your memory bank ... or go rogue and skip the smile entirely. \"Think about an animal or something that instantly makes you laugh,\" Ruvinsky says. \"If that doesn't work, mug it!\"AdvertisementEveryone has that friend who fancies themselves a photo pro and believes springing into a crouched position and dictating directions will make for the best portraits. While that agility can make for some interesting action shots, it's also a surefire way to ensure double chins all around. Your right as the subject is to put the kibosh on that kind of nonsense. \"Make sure your photographer doesn't shoot any low angles,\" Ruvinsky says. So speak up and get your camera person to come to eye level or above.And if you want a little more insurance to protect against an unbecoming outcome, adding a subtle repositioning can work wonders. \"A little bend at the waist toward the camera helps you keep your chin lifted.\"Above all else, have fun! Or at least give it your best shot.If all else fails, grab some buddies. According to a study published in the journal Psychological Science, people appear more attractive in photos when they're presented as a group versus alone due to a phenomenon called the \"cheerleader effect.\" Go team!"},

That critical network of satellites helps people with everything from navigating across town to determining when, exactly, they got cash from the ATM. And some think we're way overdue to make that network more resilient. ", "That constellation coverage ensures that you can spot at least four different satellites from pretty much anywhere on Earth."], "date": null, "content": "If you think GPS is there only to help you navigate to that new restaurant or find the fastest route across town, you'd be wrong. The signals from GPS satellites are fundamental to every network in the United States \u2014 internet, power grid, financial trading, telecommunications and, yes, transportation. But there's no backup to the system, which means a big disruption, spoof or hack could bring the entire country to its knees.A new system called eLoran, which has its origin in World War II ground-based radio technology, could complement GPS and give it the resilience it needs. Other countries have such a backup, including China and Russia. But despite administrations as far back as 2008 announcing the U.S. would build such a system, it has yet to do so.\"This is a national infrastructure issue,\" says Dana Goward, president of Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports policies and systems to make GPS more resilient.For GPS and the systems that depend on it, it's all about the timing. Literally. The 24 operational satellites in orbit around Earth each carry as many as four atomic clocks onboard that keep precise time down to the nanosecond and are all synchronized with each other and to Coordinated Universal Time. When satellites broadcast signals, they're broadcasting their time and position to receivers on Earth, like your smartphone, located along those critical networks. The receivers use the differences in arrival time of those signals to determine position.The signals are why you get an alert when your Lyft driver is about to arrive. Nodes in the internet use the signals to keep track of packets of information moving at light speed across the network. They need to know what time it is so that they can reassemble the packets of information that originated in Omaha onto your laptop in Boston. On the electrical grid, phase measurement units use GPS signals to make sure that sine waves of electricity match up where two grids come together. A mismatch can generate too much heat and create energy loss.Telecommunication networks use GPS signals to keep their cellphone towers synchronized to prevent your call from dropping on that train ride to grandma's house. Your credit card purchases, ATM withdrawals and financial market transactions all have precise time-stamps thanks to GPS.You can see where we're going here. A snafu in GPS can create some seriously snarly problems. And it's not too difficult to do. GPS satellites transmit weak, very high-frequency signals that travel to Earth through 12,645 miles (20,350 kilometers) of space and atmosphere. Space weather can mess them up by accident. People can mess them up on purpose. There are products sold online that, depending on cost and quality, can illegally jam GPS signals in a radius anywhere between 100 feet (30 meters) and 30 miles (48 kilometers).\"It's not a problem until it's a problem,\" says Goward.AdvertisementIn April 2016, Reuters reported that dozens of South Korean fish vessels had to return to port because their GPS devices had been jammed \u2014 evidently by North Korea.On Jan. 12, 2016, two U.S. Navy boats sailed 50 miles (80 kilometers) into Iranian territorial waters and were seized by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy. Goward wrote an editorial for the Christian Science Monitor suggesting that Iran may have spoofed the boats' GPS devices with fake signals, purposely throwing the vessels off course.Last January 2016, the U.S. Air Force decommissioned a GPS satellite, something it's routinely doing, and in the process introduced a 13.7-microsecond error to ripple through half of the GPS satellites still in orbit. The error created thousands of disruptions around the globe for the next 12 hours, including system errors in telecommunication networks, the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B), an aircraft tracking safety system and first responder networks in North America.\"Fortunately, as far as we can tell, nobody died and unfortunately, there were no headlines. So things have pretty much continued on as they were,\" says Goward. \"But it is evidence that these systems are all linked and these faults and failures occur even when there's a really, really small discrepancy in GPS.\"AdvertisementThe eLoran system provides a backup plan. The system, first called LORAN \u2014 which stood for \"Long Range Aid to Navigation\" \u2014 was originally a secret system deployed by the U.S. across much of the globe during World War II. After the war, the U.S. Coast Guard maintained a number of transmitter sites overseas in support of the Department of Defense, and a network of more than 25 in the United States. Each of the transmitters used atomic clocks synchronized to the Naval Observatory's Coordinated Universal Time and broadcast precise time signals.But then the more accurate GPS came along and the United States set Loran aside. An enhanced Loran, or eLoran, under development by the U.S. Coast Guard, was picked up, perfected, and demonstrated by commercial entities and the British maritime navigation authorities.The plan in the United States is to reuse the same terrestrial infrastructure as the previous Loran system to broadcast low-frequency, very high-power time signals that are 1.3 million times stronger than those coming from GPS satellites, says Goward.The combination of low-frequency radio waves transmitted at a super high power make them virtually impossible to jam. They can penetrate buildings, underground and even go underwater \u2014 which could help with navigational apps in these places. Research has shown, says Goward, that when eLoran is used in tandem with GPS, the combination is more accurate than either alone.This past July, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill stating that, \"Subject to the availability of appropriations, the Secretary shall provide for the establishment, sustainment, and operation of a reliable land-based enhanced LORAN, or eLORAN, positioning, navigation, and timing system.\" The same month, the House also passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, which allocated $10 million to build a proof-of-concept system to complement and back up GPS.Goward thinks that money could go toward a first phase of the final system, which could involve enhancing four of the eight remaining towers across the middle of the continental United States.\"You could immediately establish a time signal to provide protection for critical infrastructure,\" he said. \"It could be done in less than a year. The $10 million dollars would be a good start on that effort.\"The rest of it may cost between $400 million and $500 million to build. But Goward doesn't think the government should do it. His foundation advocates for a private-public partnership between government and business. The idea is that a company would build out the rest of the infrastructure, sell a subscription to the government and sell higher resolution services to private companies \u2014 which the government would get a cut of \u2014 while also providing basic service to the public for free.At this stage, it's unclear how the U.S. government will proceed. But technology marches on without the government, and as the world grows increasingly dependent on networks and automation, something will have to give.\"We're relying on what the Department of Homeland Security calls a single-point-of-failure for critical infrastructure\" says Goward. \"That means when it fails, that has the potential to cause even bigger failures.\""},

Plant out after all danger of frost has passed, spacing plants 6 inches apart. Work a slow-release fertilizer into the soil at planting for feeding all summer. Where keeping an even soil moisture level is a problem, a mulch is suggested. Deadheading spent flowers occasionally will improve their appearance.Propagating monkey flower: By seed. Sow seeds indoors 10 to 12 days prior to planting outdoors. Do not cover the fine seeds. Germination takes 7 to 14 days at 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit.Uses for monkey flower: Mimulus thrives nears ponds, pools, and streams.

And while there is no silver bullet to dispatch all our climate problems, electric cars could be one way we can begin to cool it on the carbon dioxide emissions. But in order to make electric cars, we need to make electric car batteries that can store enough energy to run a car. And for that, we need lithium.But the problem is, this light, silvery metal is becoming increasingly hard to come by. Most of the world's lithium supply comes from igneous rock deposits in Australia and salt flats in Chile. But as we continue mining those deposits to power our cellphones, laptops and power tools (and to manufacture things like nuclear weapons and psychiatric drugs), the possibilities of what we can do with lithium-ion batteries becomes more limited. We can't use what we can't find.AdvertisementBut a recent study published in the journal Nature Communications suggests that researchers from Stanford University and the U.S. Geological Survey might have found a new source of lithium in North America's supervolcanoes.Sounds exciting! But what does that mean?Supervolcanoes are volcanic features whose eruptions can be up to 10,000 times bigger than your average volcano in, say, Hawaii. They spew magma up to 240 cubic miles (1,000 cubic kilometers) in all directions and create massive calderas \u2014 giant holes that gradually fill up with water over time. Crater Lake in Oregon is a great example of one of these lakes formed by a super-eruption that happened thousands of years ago. How does this potentially help us make batteries? Over tens of thousands of years, lithium from the volcanic deposits leeches out of the water that fills the basin, and the metal settles to the bottom, forming a clay called hectorite.The research team looked at samples of rock from caldera sites in Nevada, Wyoming and Colorado, even comparing samples from similar sites in Mexico and Sicily, to determine exactly how much lithium we could expect to squeeze from an ancient supervolcanic rock. According to the researchers, the prospects are good.\"If you have a lot of magma erupting, it doesn't have to have as much lithium in it to produce something that is worthy of economic interest as we previously thought,\" said co-author Gail Mahood, a professor of geological sciences at Stanford's School of Earth, Energy & Environmental Sciences, in a press release. \"You don't need extraordinarily high concentrations of lithium in the magma to form lithium deposits and reserves.\"Which is super, because lithium might be essential to humanity's energy future, and domestic sources of lithium could benefit the United States.\"We're going to have to use electric vehicles and large storage batteries to decrease our carbon footprint,\" Mahood said. \"It's important to identify lithium resources in the U.S. so that our supply does not rely on single companies or countries in a way that makes us subject to economic or political manipulation.\"Global lithium prices more than doubled in just two months at the end of 2015."},

Not only is digitizing a great way to preserve all of your remembrances for generations to come, but it also can be a wonderful way to surprise your in-laws by secretly gathering it all, sending it to a company to have it digitized and then presenting it to them as a gift.The results? Once digitized, you'll no longer need to worry about that old media fading over time. Instead, it can be automatically repaired with smart software (think restoring color, removing redeye and stitching rips), and organized and easily searched by keyword (on a computer, tablet, phone or online cloud site). You can even share it with friends and family over email and social media, or use it to create fun projects like scrapbooks, slideshows and refrigerator magnets.The two main options for digitizing your vintage media are to do it yourself \u2014 which can be expensive, as every format requires a compatible playback device, time-consuming and can require quite a lot of technical expertise \u2014 or using a professional service like the one co-founded by Nick Macco and Adam Boeselager in their college garage in 2009 that has since gone on to become one of the largest digitizing companies in the world, helping 850,000 families and counting.\"Legacybox was created to help families reconnect with their important recorded memories that are being lost on outdated and deteriorating tapes, film and pictures,\" says Macco. \"In essence, it's a safe, simple, mail-in solution for digitally converting your old media files like VHS and audio tapes, film and/or photo prints.\" How does it work? Customers order their kit online, pack their media files upon arrival and send it in for digitizing. Each kit includes a step-by-step welcome guide, safety barcodes for every single media item and a pre-paid UPS shipping label. Customers then receive their digitized files within three to four weeks either on the cloud, a USB drive or DVD. All of the original files \u2014 old videotapes, film reels, pictures and audio recordings \u2014 also are returned.AdvertisementIt's vital to ensure your media's safety and accessibility for a number of reasons, according to Macco. Most importantly, so you can pass on your most beloved memories for generations to come. \"It's a simple process that will give you peace of mind that these important moments of your past won't be lost forever,\" he says. \"One occasion that solidified the importance of digitizing for me was in the early days of the company when I digitized media files that belonged to my grandparents of their life and our family together. I digitized them for a slideshow we played at their 50th wedding anniversary, which was then shared around with our entire family. It brought everyone to tears. I knew by my own family's reaction that what we were doing \u2014 giving families back the best times of their lives \u2014 was something impactful and something worth keeping at.\"Macco's top reasons for digitizing your media include:\"When your media isn't digitized, so much can go wrong,\" he says. \"Not only do you need a safe place to store it, but there's always risk of a natural disaster, loss during a move, or degradation due to wear and tear. Key storage locations (like closets, basements or trunks) can be compromised, but if your memories are digitized you can rest easy that they'll be protected against damage forever.\"Digitizing your media can create space for optimal storage, according to Macco. \"Once that bin full of old media and home videos are digitized, it can free up spaces in closets, trunks and shelves,\" he says. \"We've even seen customers repurpose vintage photos around their home after the digitization process is complete.\"AdvertisementWhen you digitize your memories you no longer have to break out the old photo album and can share at will with anybody, anywhere. Instead, all you have to do is upload your digitized media and hit send. \"Just like that, you can relive and recall all your precious memories with those that matter most, near and far,\" says Macco.\"If you want to ensure family tradition and memories are lasting, it's vital to pass your memories on to your kids and grandkids for generations to come,\" he says. \"You can replace boxes of old tapes with an easy-to-share cloud link that can be shared with your entire family and beyond.\"Every format is digitally preserved a little differently, according to Macco. Even slides, negatives and photo prints differ in how they are best captured. However, every item is handled by hand. \"Our film digitizing process is the same frame-by-frame method used by the Academy of Motion Pictures,\" he says. \"It's amazing what you can discover on old film reels.\"Legacybox offers a variety of kits to fit the number of items a customer wants to digitize, along with a range of price points. A two-item starter kit is $59.99, for example, while a 10-item family kit costs $279.99, 20-item closet kit is $549.99 and 40-item trunk kit $1,099.99. All vary in number of photos, tapes, audio and reels you're able to digitize. There are many other companies that offer similar services as well.\"We've designed our product and experience to provide customers with peace of mind throughout every step of the digitizing process with our pioneered 12-step tracking system,\" Macco says. Each digitizing kit comes with barcode labels for each media file that customers send in, so that it's tracked throughout the entire process. State-of-the-art, high-tech digitizing tools are then used to ensure that the final digitized versions look beautiful and are professionally produced.Kodak launched Super 8mm film in May 1965, providing great image quality and revolutionizing amateur filmmaking in the process. Kodak also came out with two cameras, the M2 and M4. Super 8 film was cheaper and more convenient than the previous, cumbersome Normal 8 format, since all you had to do was pop the film cassette into the camera, take it out after recording and turn it in for processing.\n\n"},

If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.Wait a minute. That's Ferris Bueller. And Ferris Bueller is like ... 55 now!Truth is, life does move pretty fast. Presidents come and go \u2014 even if they're re-elected \u2014 inside the space of a decade. It's been 10 years since the binge-watching daddy of TV shows, \"Breaking Bad,\" hit TV screens. Come and gone.Life moves fast, all right. Here are 10 things that weren't even around just a decade ago.AdvertisementSure, 10 years ago, it was easy enough to find a ride to, say, the airport. It was called getting a taxi. But in 2008, you couldn't hail a cab with a few taps on your smartphone. And, back then, it wasn't just some Joe waiting at the curb and ushering you into his Accord. It was a cabbie who probably had an attitude. You had to pay cash, too, and leave a tip. Uber, with its slick app and interconnected fleet of Joe-owned cars, put the brakes on all that. (Well, the tips are back.)The cryptocurrency \u2014 was anything even called a cryptocurrency in 2008? \u2014 made its debut a little less than a decade ago, and the sort-of electronic cash has slowly made its way into the hearts and virtual wallets of enough people, evidently, that by the end of 2017 more than $243 billion dollars' worth of Bitcoin was out there. We're not sure what good it is if, just for a for-instance, McDonald's doesn't take it. But word on the cryptostreet is that Joe at Uber might accept it soon.Nothing typifies the technological strides of the past decade quite like the photo-sharing app Instagram, though some might argue that selfie-loving Instagrammers are a stride back on the evolutionary scale. Introduced in 2010 for Apple, and two years later for Android, Instagram (IG for those in the know) has hundreds of millions of monthly users who share some 95 million photos (and videos) a day. Since 2010, IGers have uploaded more than 40 billion photos.OK, maybe this is that big step back for humankind. Devices for holding cameras, of course, have been around for a lot longer than 10 years. But since the advent of smartphones with front-facing cameras, and given the length-limitations of a human arm and our basic need to be take and upload selfies (were they around 10 years ago?), selfie sticks became an answer to a problem we never used to have. The selfie stick hit its zenith when it was named one of Time magazine's 25 best inventions of 2014. Really Time?AdvertisementAnother newcomer that owes its life \u2014 like many of us \u2014 to the internet, Spotify is the music streaming choice of some 140 million users a month, who build and swap playlists from a library containing some 30 million songs (the Obama White House was famous for its playlists). Launched in late 2008, Spotify is free, if you don't mind a few ads here and there. Or, if you want to ditch the ads, it's $9.99 a month. You can download tracks, too, to listen to offline. It's basically a gigantic jukebox, for you old folks, that you listen to on your smartphone.In 2018, if you're not woke, you're out if it. Come to think of it, \"woke\" may not be woke anymore. Whatever the case, back in the dark ages \u2014 say, 2007 \u2014 no one knew what woke meant. But in 2008, the wordsmiths at Merriam-Webster, who pay attention to these things, slipped it into their big book (it's like like your smartphone, only with paper instead of a screen) and made it an official part of the lexicon. If you don't know what it means, you better get woke.Another winner in the new sharing economy is Airbnb. Since its launch in 2008, it's messed with the hotel industry much like Uber has disrupted the taxi business. The Airbnb app and website hook up willing space-holders (that room over your garage? Perfect!) with hotel-averse travelers. Airbnb has places in more than 65,000 cities in more than 191 countries and has provided a resting spot for more than 200 million people. How did we ever travel without it?The internet was launched way more than 10 years ago (thanks, Al Gore!), and it'll be around for many more. As long as it is, it will spur inventions like Snapchat, an overtly covert messaging app (the images disappear by default after a set time) that debuted in 2011. Snapchat and its friendly little ghost icon were super popular among teens for a while \u2014 not to mention the self-nudie set (no traces, you know) \u2014 and still boasts more than 170 million users a day.  Elon Musk probably dreamt of building impossibly cool and fast cars 40 years ago as a boy in South Africa. But it wasn't until 2008 that he launched the Tesla Roadster, an all-electric vehicle that has forever changed the car industry. The Roadster was followed by other futuristic-looking Teslas, and now every car maker on a grateful Earth is racing toward an all-electric future. The company is a leader in autonomous driving tech, too. Hold onto your seats in the next decade.AdvertisementThe iPhone, the first true techno-gadget crush for millions of Americans, is way old. It was introduced all the way back in 2007. But it was just in the last decade (2010) that Apple shook up the doo-dad world when it gave us the iPhone on steroids: the iPad. It's a tablet computer that put the power of a desktop machine right onto the living room couch (and in the car). It wasn't the first tablet or the last, but it made the biggest impact. Sales have fallen some, victim of ever-smarter smartphones. But the iPad lives. Apple sold 10.3 million of them in the third quarter of 2017 alone.Although it may seem to some a new phenomenon, thanks to the current Tweeter in Chief, the social (and sometimes news) networking app Twitter launched way back in 2006. Donald Trump, though, joined in March 2009, and has tweeted more than 36,000 times since then, which works out to more than 300 (sometimes flaming) tweets a month. He has almost 46 million followers, and Twitter has more than 330 million active users worldwide."},

In the weeks leading up to the show, some journalists predicted that attendance would be down and exhibitors would scale back on their booths.

If you said yes, then there's good news. This device already exists. We're talking about dashboard cameras \u2014 or dashcams.If you could have an accessory for your car that could potentially help you out of a jam with your insurance company, would you buy it? If you said yes, then there's good news. This device already exists. We're talking about dashboard cameras \u2014 or dashcams.That's because a mounted dashboard camera will record everything that's happening in front of your car while you drive, essentially functioning as a silent witness to collisions or other incidents. A dashcam might also make would-be thieves or vandals think twice about messing with your car. And, as a bonus, you never know what else a dashcam might catch in the world just beyond your windshield.Dashcams aren't as common in the United States as they are in many other countries, and the reasons for that are unclear. They aren't particularly expensive and they're easy to install and use.The insurance industry's reluctance to fully embrace dashcams might be one contributing factor in their failure to achieve widespread usage, and that's really the only potential drawback of this useful tool. For now, let's take a closer look at the potential benefits of a dashcam.AdvertisementAccording to Mark Friedlander, director of corporate communications at the Insurance Information Institute, the benefits of dashcams outweigh any potential drawbacks. The Insurance Information Institute is a nonprofit that helps consumers navigate issues with the insurance industry.The main selling point of a dashcam is to provide evidence in the event of a car accident. Though the camera typically records incidents through the windshield, some drivers choose to put a second dashcam in the rear window to capture evidence of rear-end collisions. Such footage would be particularly beneficial if the owner of the dashcam was not the driver at fault. But Friedlander notes via email that \"a real-time video record benefits all parties involved in a traffic accident.\"Dashcam footage is also useful if someone tries to blame a driver for an accident that isn't their fault, which the insurance industry considers fraud (more on this later).On a similar note, Friedlander says, dashcam footage can be useful in fighting wrongfully issued traffic citations, particularly those from traffic cameras. Furthermore, dashcam footage may be useful in catching car thieves and vandals, and the supporting insurance claims related to such incidents. Dashcams can also monitor driver behavior, whether that's an employee in a fleet vehicle or a newly licensed teenage driver.AdvertisementWhile dashcams benefit the drivers who install them, they're also useful for insurance companies. Fraud accounted for between 15 and 17 percent of total claims for auto insurance bodily injury in 2012, according to an Insurance Research Council (IRC) study. The study also estimated that between $5.6 and $7.7 billion was fraudulently added to paid claims for auto insurance bodily injury payments in 2012. This is due to what the insurance industry calls \"staged accidents,\" and if you're the victim of such a staged accident (that is, the other driver involved when someone deliberately collides with you and then claims to be the victim), a dashcam recording can provide valuable evidence to support your story and expose the fraud. Check out the tweet below to see how a dashcam can be invaluable in this sort of incident.Supporting policies that encourage dashcam use could cut down on these fraudulent claims, which could, in turn, lower insurance premiums for all customers. It will also save the victims from the rate increases that are common after an at-fault collision.No major auto insurance companies currently offer a discount for installing a dashcam, though the state of New York is considering legislation that will require it (see sidebar). Furthermore, insurance companies don't have official policies on whether they'll review footage of a crash, which seems perplexing considering insurance adjusters do review photographs.Why are photos acceptable if videos may not be? One theory, according to Car and Driver magazine, is that insurance companies don't want to see anything that may incriminate their customers. And on that note, if insurers have an official stance on dashcams, they can't evaluate each situation on a case-by-case basis.However, Friedlander says, insurance companies are gradually changing their viewpoint.\"Dashcams are increasingly being used to provide U.S. property/casualty insurers with additional information about accidents, traffic violations and driving habits. In fact, many insurance carriers will accept dashcam footage from their policyholders in the case of an accident to assist in assessing a claim.\"AdvertisementA decent-quality dashcam costs $60 to $150. The most basic dashcams plug into the car's cigarette lighter or run off a battery. Others are somewhat more complicated to install because they're connected to the car's electrical system. Experts recommend an HD-quality camera; otherwise, your recordings may miss important details like facial features or license plate numbers.The variety of models on the market can be overwhelming, so consider the following attributes, as recommended by Popular Science:Before you install your dashcam, make sure you know your local laws regarding window-mounted objects to ensure you won't get ticketed for obstructing your view. Clean the glass and then mount the camera based on the manufacturer's recommendations.If you need to run wires to your cigarette lighter, you can keep them out of your way by taping or clipping them to the closest windshield edge, and then along the dashboard. If your dashcam taps into your car's electrical system for power, it's probably best to have it installed by a professional.New York State may incentivize dashcam use, if Assembly Bill A5132, currently in a Senate committee, is approved. According to Friedlander, if the law passes, it will provide a 5 percent auto insurance premium reduction for passenger vehicles using and operating a dashboard camera. As for the insurance industry's take on the proposed law, Friedlander says, \"U.S. insurers continue to assess the impact of dashcam cameras on driver safety and whether they help to reduce claim and theft expenses.\""},

The sprawling Las Vegas show has been around for decades, allowing companies and manufacturers to connect with corporate customers like retail chains. And we in media play a big part, too, as we try to suss out the most exciting tech in development.And to think CES wouldn't even exist without radio. Back in the 1920s, several companies decided that it made more sense to work together to promote technology rather than battle over formats. Of course, in the '20s, consumer technology was pretty much the realm of the radio. In fact, the organization born from these companies collaborating was the Radio Manufacturers Association (it's now known as the Consumer Technology Association, or CTA).AdvertisementIn fact, the first CES was actually a spinoff from another show called the Chicago Music Show. As the Music Show grew, manufacturers wanted to trot out tech that wasn't strictly in the music space. As a result, the organization launched CES in 1967 to give consumer electronics its own showcase.Eventually, CES called two cities home: Chicago and Las Vegas. Chicago hosted a summer event while Las Vegas played home to a winter CES, kind of like the Olympics. Over time, scheduling challenges and a lower attendee count prompted the CTA to scrap the summer event. These days, Las Vegas is where it's at.Some seriously big-name products have debuted at CES over the years. Attendees were among the first to experience technology like the VCR, the CD player, the DVD player and more. Media devices have always played a huge role at the show. Today is no exception. You only have to peek into the Central Hall at the Las Vegas Convention Center to see how televisions remain one of the most popular products on the show floor.Of course, we're seeing other types of technology at CES these days. There are 3-D printers, robots, virtual reality headsets and a seemingly endless parade of products in the Internet of Things category. Stay tuned to HowStuffWorks Now as we explore the tech on display this week!"},

It's enticing to study people who are full of good ideas \u2014 even more so, people who have built empires, as we try to uncover exactly how they did it.Beyond that, Jobs was an interesting character. He was a college dropout who won the National Medal of Technology, who had a reputation as a difficult person and a demanding boss, and who slammed competitors' products and ran a cultish marketing show for his own.AdvertisementOne New York Times columnist had an interesting sociological explanation for why we've always taken a personal interest in Jobs [source: Carr]. Jobs knew us so well \u2014 from our early need for personal computers to the way our fingers like to dial songs on our iPods \u2014 that we want to know him back.Jobs kept details about his life private, and his company protected his privacy, which enticed us even more. Our fascination fed a rumor mill that often got stuff wrong. Here are five popular myths that surround Jobs."},

This search has led to major development in two key areas of technology: energy and electronics. The search for ever-better power sources has led to large-scale electric utility services, rechargeable batteries, and devices for harnessing renewable energy from the world around us, such as wind turbines and solar panels. In electronics, developers are continually on the quest for cheaper yet more powerful devices that use less energy than their predecessor technologies.What if we could produce electricity from the power we generate just by being alive? Imagine if you could keep your iPod charged just by tapping your fingers to the beat of the music or by wearing a hoodie with a tiny embedded circuit board that senses your pulse. Though it might sound like science fiction, nanogenerators are bringing such power sources into reality.AdvertisementNanogenerator is the term researchers use to describe a small electronic chip that can use mechanical movements of the body, such as a gentle finger pinch, to generate electricity [source: ACS]. The chip has an integrated circuit etched onto a flexible surface, similar to components on the circuit boards inside your computer. As the \"nano-\" prefix implies, these generators are a piece of nanotechnology, or technology so small its size is measured by the nanometer (one billionth of a meter). So, even the most complex and powerful nanogenerators in existence today are small enough to be held between two fingers.The key components inside a nanogenerator are nanowires or a similar structure made from a piezoelectric ceramic material. Piezoelectric materials can generate an electric current just by being bent or stressed. As described in How Nanowires Work, hundreds of nanowires can be packed side by side in a space less than the width of a human hair. At that scale, and with the combined flexibility of the nanogenerator's components, even the slightest movement can generate current.Besides being incredibly small and responsive, nanogenerators are increasingly powerful. In March 2011, researchers measured the output of five nanogenerators stacked together. This tiny stack produced a current of about one microampere, which produced three volts of energy, about the same as two AA batteries [source: ACS].Want to take a closer look at nanogenerator technology and how the practical application of nanogenerators will affect our lives? Let's start with some of the research behind nanogenerators.\u00a0"},

The basic technology is the same in that both television types have two layers of polarized glass through which the liquid crystals both block and pass light. So really, LED TVs are a subset of LCD TVs.LED, which stands for \u201clight emitting diodes,\u201d differs from general LCD TVs in that LCDs use fluorescent lights while LEDs use those light emitting diodes. Also, the placement of the lights on an LED TV can differ. The fluorescent lights in an LCD TV are always behind the screen. On an LED TV, the light emitting diodes can be placed either behind the screen or around its edges. The difference in lights and in lighting placement has generally meant that LED TVs can be thinner than LCDs, although this is starting to change. It has also meant that LED TVs run with greater energy efficiency and can provide a clearer, better picture than the general LCD TVs.AdvertisementLED TVs provide a better picture for two basic reasons. First, LED TVs work with a color wheel or distinct RGB-colored lights (red, green, blue) to produce more realistic and sharper colors. Second, light emitting diodes can be dimmed. The dimming capability on the back lighting in an LED TV allows the picture to display with a truer black by darkening the lights and blocking more light from passing through the panel. This capability is not present on edge-lit LED TVs; however, edge-lit LED TVs can display a truer white than the fluorescent LED TVs.Because all these LCD TVs are thin-screen, each has particular angle-viewing and anti-glare issues. The backlit TVs provide better, cleaner angle viewing than the edge-lit LED TV. However, the backlit LED TV will usually have better angle viewing than the standard LCD TV. Both LED and LCD TVs have good reputations for their playback and gaming quality.Originally Published: Jul 22, 2011"},

At times, though, that kind of tracking can start to feel inconvenient or even oppressive. Whether you're a teenager trying to hide from your parents or more seriously, someone with an abusive significant other who is obsessively keeping tabs on them, there are ways to trick the location tracking features on your device.But you're going to need some outside help to do it. Regardless of whether you use an Android or iPhone, there isn't a simple one-button setting that will instantly alter your virtual location. You'll have to do a bit of digging to make your deception a reality.The GPS chip in your phone is meant to be as accurate as possible, and, when it's turned on, it continually updates your position by relaying coordinates to your phone's operating system (OS). The OS then shares that data with apps that rely on location information. To get around that, you'll have to deceive those apps into accepting false GPS data.In the Google Play store you'll find plenty of apps meant to enable GPS fakery for Android devices. We'll use Fake GPS Location \u2013 GPS Joystick as an example.AdvertisementAdvertisementFaking the location of an iPhone requires more effort than with Android devices because you can't simply install an app. The easiest way is to use your computer, and keep in mind this only works with iPhones running iOS 12 or older operating systems.Another option that will work with any operating system above iOS8 is Dr. Fone:If you just want to turn off your location information without trying to fool people into thinking you're someplace else, it's pretty easy. On iPhones, go to Settings > Privacy > Location Services. Toggle the Location Services button from \"On\" to \"Off\" to turn off location information. For Android phones, go to Settings > Connections > Location. Toggle the Location button from \"On\" to \"Off\" to turn off location information. Note that some apps won't work properly if the location information is turned off.Hot to play hooky? Keep in mind that faking your GPS signal isn't always a foolproof way to throw people off your tracks. If someone (like your parents) pays for a service that tracks your phone through your service provider, GPS apps like the ones we mentioned won't hide your true location.Originally Published: Nov 25, 2019"},

The tale ends at your dinner table with a salmon steak or tuna casserole that has the requisite nutritional bounty, as well as some substances you definitely don't want anywhere near your family, like mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT).One big problem is that many fish varieties are susceptible to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that accumulate in their fatty tissues. The longer the fish live, and the more other infected organisms they eat, the more pollutants they accumulate. Pollutants aren't limited to wild fish, either. Farmed raised salmon, for instance, can have higher concentrations of chemicals like PCBs than their free swimming counterparts. (This is probably a nasty surprise, but read on.) Pollution isn't the only potential problem, either. Fish and shellfish spoil quickly and can also harbor dangerous microorganisms that make people sick."},

The phones they abandon are often still perfectly functional (if perhaps a bit sluggish), and there's the question of what one should do with those older devices.Whatever you do, don't simply chuck your old phone in the garbage. They contain lithium-ion batteries that constitute a real fire hazard, and they can even explode in some circumstances. By one estimate, 65 percent of waste facility fires (in California, at least) were ignited due to discarded cell phone batteries [source: Siegal].AdvertisementIn addition to the possibility of fire, cell phones electronics are composed of a veritable treasure trove of valuable components. They're are made with precious metals, copper and plastics, all of which can be recycled to make new products. Even so, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency currently estimates only about 20 percent of all cell phones are recycled [source: LeBlanc].Most cell phone providers have drop-off bins or mail-in programs to make recycling your old phone easy, but there are lots of ways you can recycle your phone and give to others. Many charities have partnered with cell phone refurbishing companies and recyclers as a way of generating funds while keeping phones out of landfills, so everybody wins. They always make sure to wipe any personal information before recycling or reusing these phones. Here are some ways to donate old phones.Cell Phones for Soldiers provides talk time to overseas troops so they can call home. Founded in 2004 by two young teenagers who were distraught after learning of a soldier who racked up an $8,000 phone bill while serving in Iraq, Cell Phones for Soldiers has since collected more than 20 million devices and given away more than 400 million minutes of talk time to service personnel.The organization collects old phones which it sells to a recycler or an electronic refurbisher, depending on the condition. It uses the proceeds to buy long distance calling cards, which are distributed to men and women who are serving in the military. Each phone donated buys about one hour of talk time for soldiers.The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV) collects cell phones to help fund their programs. They accept phones and partner with Cellular Recycler, which sells refurbished electronics. Some of the funds from those sales then goes back to NCADV. They'll also accept other types of old electronics, too, including old laptops, digital cameras, video game consoles, and MP3 players, along with all of the related charging cords and accessories.Second Wave Recycling is an organization that accepts older phones, iPods and MP3 players, tablets and e-readers, handheld gaming devices, smart watches and even charging cables. Newer and functional devices are refurbished and then sold for cash. Older devices are recycled. The money from those processes is donated to fund a designated charity. Second Wave is actively funding the Wounded Warrior Project, which offers support services for military personnel who've been hurt while serving the U.S., but the organization has supported other causes, too, including charities that benefit medical patients, domestic abuse survivors, animals rescues, and many others. You can choose which charity to support.Did you know that all cell phones sold in the U.S., regardless of their carrier subscription status, must be able to dial 911 in case of an emergency? So that half-decade-old phone tucked away in storage will still call for an ambulance or police assistance, provided the battery is chargeable. 911 Cell Phone Bank is an organization that accepts used cell phones and recycles them to victims of abuse for emergency use; to law enforcement (for instance to replace a broken screen on a phone a suspect intentionally damaged) and to classrooms for use in app development courses.Why stash your old phone in a shoebox in the attic when it could be used to save lives? Medic Mobile recycles and refurbishes old phones and tablets and uses the funds to buy mobile devices that medical workers use on the job in 26 countries, mostly in Asia, Latin America, or Africa. These devices register pregnancies, track disease outbreaks, and communicate about medical emergencies.Originally Published: Apr 30, 2019"},

In July 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Traced Act, a law that toughens punishments against illegal robocalls and requires phone companies to check if a call is genuine.Unfortunately, while tougher punishments and better caller verification may help reduce robocalls, some still sneak through. Smartphone owners can reduce the chances they'll receive unwanted calls by installing apps on their phones that can identify robocallers and screen them out before they get through. One of the most well-known of these apps is Nomorobo, a service available for both landlines and cell phones.AdvertisementSmartphone users can download the Nomorobo app via the Apple App Store or on Google Play. As calls come in, the app checks the number against a list of known robocallers. The service identifies more than 1,500 new robocallers each day. If you sign up, you have two choices when a call comes in. The app can tell you if a call is a possible robocall but let it ring through for you to check, or you can set the app to send possible robocallers directly to voicemail. In that case, your smartphone won't even ring.Nomorobo's apps are also able to screen text messages for spam. If the app determines you got a junk text, the message goes to an SMS Junk folder for you to review.Here's how to set it up: On your smartphone, first download the app. To activate it on your iPhone, click on Phone, then click on Call Blocking & Identification and then enable Nomorobo.

Penny stocks get their name because of their low share price. Any stock trading below $5 a share is generally considered a penny stock. A low share price can mean several things: Maybe it's a new company that's just starting out; maybe it's an established company that's fallen on hard times; or maybe it's not a real company at all! The problem with penny stocks is that it's often hard to tell which of these situations is true.Investing in a stock means that you're buying a share of that company's total value. Stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ represent established companies with long track records that are required to file regular financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). For that reason, it's easier (although still not \"easy\" by any means) for investors to predict whether a company's value is on the rise or in decline.Penny stocks, on the other hand, are not traded on the big stock exchanges, but rather through \"over-the-counter\" (OTC) transactions based on prices listed on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) and OTC Link (formerly the Pink Sheets). Companies are often traded on the OTC markets because they can't meet the strict SEC financial reporting requirements of a larger stock exchange. What that means for investors is that it's much harder to know the true financial health of a company being traded as a penny stock. Sometimes it's even hard to figure out what business the company is in!AdvertisementJames Royal, an investment writer with Bankrate, worries that new investors are attracted to penny stocks for all the wrong reasons. They see a stock listed for pennies a share and think, \"If this stock goes up just one dollar and I own tons of shares, I'd make a fortune!\"\"But the reality is, for a penny stock to go up one dollar might require a 300-percent gain,\" says Royal. \"That kind of result is tough enough to achieve when you're investing in top-notch companies, let alone the poorly run companies in the penny stock world.\"Royal says that penny stocks are cheap for a reason. Their market value is so low because investors as a whole have determined that there's little hope of these companies becoming viable, profitable businesses. That's not to say that all penny stock companies are doomed to failure. A few might be on the verge of a major turnaround. But to figure that out, smart investors have to do two things: ignore the noise and do their homework.AdvertisementFirst, ignore the noise. The penny stock market is rife with snake oil salesmen promoting the next hot stock tip. There are innumerable online investment newsletters and blogs purporting to pick penny stocks that are about to strike gold. Investors should steer clear of amateur stock analysts. Some are on the company's payroll, hired to hype the company and raise the stock price. Others are participating in illegal \"pump and dump\" schemes, in which shareholders make false claims to inflate a company's share price and then immediately sell off all their shares when the stock spikes.For accurate information about a company's current and potential earnings, you'll need to go to the source. Since few penny stock companies file financial reports with the SEC (you can search for SEC filings), you must call up the companies directly and ask for copies of any and all financial statements. Again, says Royal, not all financial reports are created equal.\"Be careful of overly promotional language promising huge benefits and gains,\" says Royal. \"And be wary of any company that doesn't want to provide you with its financial statements. That's a huge red flag.\"Interpreting those financial statements and analyzing the company's position in the larger market is hard work. That's one of the biggest reasons while Royal and most other financial writers strongly discourage new investors from messing around with penny stocks. Without reliable advice from experienced and neutral stock analysts, you're largely on your own.If you're dead set on giving penny stocks a try, follow these tips from Brian O'Connell at The Balance:Financial regulators don't want new investors to fall victim to penny stock scams. In addition to arresting and fining perpetrators \"pump and dump\" schemes, they provide helpful tips for recognizing when a stock is too good to be true."},

These old-school radios make short-range wireless communications possible in places where cell phones go to die.Walkie-talkies are wireless, hand-held radios that are small enough to take just about anywhere. They look a lot like cordless phone handsets, with a body that includes a microphone and speaker, as well as an antenna. Unlike a phone, though, a walkie-talkie's speaker and microphone are placed right next to each other, and the speaker is much louder, so that anyone within earshot can follow the conversation.AdvertisementWalkie-talkies are battery-powered transceivers, meaning they can both send and receive radio messages. They have a half-duplex channel, which indicates that only one walkie-talkie on a channel can transmit a signal at one time, although many radios can receive that same signal. In other words, unlike your phone, in which both parties can interrupt or add to the conversation in a ceaseless flow of sound, walkie-talkies use a push-to-talk (PTT) system -- you have to press a button in order to speak, and you have to release that button to hear sound coming from other units.Because you don't have to dial a number each time you want to transmit, walkie-talkies are quick and easy to use. And best of all, they don't rely on finicky cell phone signals. The handsets transmit directly to each other, so they still work when cell networks fail during natural disasters or power outages. They're designed primarily for short-range communications, in which groups of people are within a few miles of each other.Businesses use walkie-talkies so that employees can chat efficiently in and around their indoor and outdoor structures. Wilderness lovers tote walkie-talkies so that they can keep in touch during hiking or hunting trips out where cell phone cover age is non-existent.

A buyer may ask questions about house maintenance, the condition of your appliances or the quality of your neighborhood and schools, but these factors pale in comparison to the feeling a buyer gets the first time he or she steps into your home. If you want to sell your house in a short amount of time and with minimum hassle, it's critical that the decor is up-to-date and attractive.You can think of your home's color palette as an important backdrop; it sets the stage for the furnishings and decorations that give rooms their unique feel. Picking the right paint is a topic that causes frustration for many. Paint is relatively simple to apply or change, but the wrong color inside or out can turn a buyer off from the entire house. To prevent this, many real estate professionals recommend painting your home in neutral colors.AdvertisementIf you're still living in the home you're selling, though, does that mean you're stuck inside a bland, beige nightmare? Not necessarily. Remember, the term \"neutral colors\" doesn't limit you to shades of white and beige. With a little pre-planning and a sense for the effect color has on the human mind, you can use browns, greens and even bolder colors to highlight your home.And don't forget about the exterior of your home: Painting the exterior can also help attract potential buyers, but be careful. While no one would think twice about painting a house in Florida peach or turquoise, chances are these colors would turn off potential buyers in a suburban Boston neighborhood.Read on to learn about 10 colors that may put visitors in the buying frame of mind."},

Our love of electronics sometimes borders on obsession. We have them in our cars, our homes, our schools and our offices. We use electronics to communicate, to work and to have fun. The shift to mobile devices has spawned even more consumerism. Households that may now have a mobile device for each member of the family.Though electronic components rely on a variety of minerals to operate, in this article we'll look at four in particular: gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten. Engineers use thin strands of gold to bond to wires -- these strands are highly conductive and resist corrosion. Tin is a soldering agent. Tantalum is a component in capacitors, which you'll find in many electronics. And tungsten is a strong metal with a very high melting point -- it's useful for applications that generate a lot of heat, like light bulbs or electronic tubes.AdvertisementWe have to mine gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten ore, which we then have to process in refining and smelting operations. This ore comes from various mines around the world but one country has been in the news more than any other: the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). And here's where the dark side of our electronics obsession comes into play.Over the last several years, the DRC has experienced massive political turmoil. Some of that comes from political issues within the country's government. But the DRC's neighbors, particularly Uganda and Rwanda on the DRC's eastern border, have also contributed to the instability in the DRC.The mines in the DRC provide a source for revenue. In the eastern part of the DRC, these mines are contested, strategic resources for several armed groups, including Congolese and Rwandan troops. Several parts of the eastern DRC are essentially lawless and these armed groups use murder and rape to intimidate the native populations into mining resources. The military may tax the mines or even smuggle the ore out of the country to sell to smelting companies. Military groups then use the money to purchase weapons and otherwise fund their efforts.The scenario is a bleak one and has prompted countries around the world to devise ways to end the cycle of violence and smuggling within the DRC. But to really understand conflict minerals, we have to look beyond the eastern DRC."},

"], "date": null, "content": "The company that developed the MP3 compression standard for audio announced in April that it was ending development of and support for the popular file format. The iconic MP3 made distributing audio online feasible. It ushered in an era of new portable technologies, like the iPod and the Diamond Rio(!). And now the format's creators are saying it's obsolete.The game-changing MP3 began as a project at Fraunhofer IIS, a German research institution,\u00a0as a continuation of initial research from the University Erlangen-Nuremberg. Serious work began in 1987. The goal was to create a method to compress audio files to make it easier to transfer them over networks. This was necessary because networks back then didn't have the capability to transfer large files quickly.AdvertisementAn uncompressed audio file can be relatively large. For example, a three-minute audio clip sampled at 44.1 kilohertz with two channels will take up about 31 megabytes of space. That's not much by today's standards, but back in 1987 that was a hefty file.The MP3 format allowed you to convert a raw audio file into a compressed MP3 file, reducing the file size to something more manageable. It did this by analyzing audio and eliminating frequencies that fall outside the range of human hearing. The logic was that if the audience couldn't hear the sound, there was no need to keep it. By cutting out all the imperceptible noise, the MP3 converter could reduce the overall file size.If we took that 31-megabyte raw audio file and ran it through an MP3 converter at a bit rate of 128 kilobytes per second, we'd end up with a file that's just 2.8 megabytes in size. That's much easier to transfer across a network.One way MP3 converters compress files is to look for frequency masking. This strategy takes advantage of a peculiarity in human hearing. If we perceive two frequencies that are similar but not quite identical and one is louder than the other, we'll only really hear the louder one. So an MP3 converter can analyze an audio track and drop any similar frequencies of lower volume since we wouldn't perceive them anyway.Another type of masking is temporal masking, in which a short, loud sound temporarily masks our ability to perceive quieter, more subtle sounds. Again, the MP3 converter can drop some sounds that we wouldn't hear due to temporal masking. In the original recording, the sounds would be there but we wouldn't hear them anyway. Out they go!The same is true for any frequencies that fall outside the typical range of human hearing, which spans from about 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz. Sounds below or above that range are outside our perception, though they may be found on a recording. Compression algorithms typically ditch these sounds to conserve space.It took some time to perfect the algorithm. According to the researchers, they would try out their compression formulas using Suzanne Vega's song \"Tom's Diner\" as a benchmark test. The earlier formulas made the song sound chunky and unpleasant, giving the researchers the feedback they needed to make changes and create a working compression algorithm.Eventually, they succeeded. The MP3 format and the introduction of the Winamp program helped create a new industry: the online distribution of digital music. It also gave rise to the MP3 player phenomenon, contributed to the birth of the iPod and, much to the chagrin of music labels, made widespread music piracy possible.Today, there are other compression algorithms that are just as effective (or better) as MP3s at compressing audio while preserving quality. And while the MP3 is taking a bow, that doesn't mean all the files will suddenly become useless. The files will still work on any devices or programs capable of playing them. But the MP3 format, which forced a major transformation in the music industry, has earned itself a rest."},

Or do you roll over, reach for the phone and call the big guy? When your boss answers, you moan, \"I can't come to work today. I live in Sweden.\"Now, your boss may not accept geographic location as a legitimate excuse for missing work. After all, companies may be particularly concerned about \"sick days\" taken by employees located near golf courses, ski slopes or beaches; about 40 percent of workers surveyed in 2007 admitted to taking a sick day to goof off [source: Schweitzer]. After calling in with a case of the sniffles, workers use the extra day to convert a two-day weekend into a three-day holiday, hitting the nearby mall, lake or amusement park.Advertisement\u00adBut the amount of sick days taken in some places extends far beyond workers in sunny climes calling in \"sick\" to take advantage of the great weather. In Germany, for example, 18 percent of workers reported taking a sick day in a one-year period, while only 8 percent of workers in Ireland called out [source: Gimeno et al]. The\u00ad amount of sick leave days that each worker takes in a year differs wildly from country to country, indicating that geographic location does seem to have some bearing on whether or not you're going to call in sick to work.But why is geographic location a factor?

Now, new research provides one answer. A study shows that women's peers are less likely to accept their coding even when their work product is just as good as (or better than) a man's.A team from California Polytechnic State University and North Carolina State University took on the behemoth issue of gender bias by way of GitHub, a collaborative software development site with 10 million users, only about 1.4 million profiles of which are identifiable by gender. Users can make software code suggestions, called \"pull requests,\" to projects being managed by other members.AdvertisementData analyzed by the researchers found that pull requests offered by female programmers whose gender was publicly available were only accepted 62.5 percent of the time, as compared with a 71.8 percent acceptance rate from women whose gender was not known.This is in stark contrast with the overall numbers, which suggest higher acceptance of pull requests made by women whose gender was unknown, but who'd already developed a solid reputation on previous projects (78.6 percent accepted), as compared with those made by men in the same boat (74.6 percent accepted).\"Surprisingly, our results show that women's contributions tend to be accepted more often than men,\" the researchers explain in the study, which they say will soon be peer-reviewed. \"However, when a woman's gender is identifiable, they are rejected more often. Our results suggest that although women on GitHub may be more competent overall, bias against them exists nonetheless.\"We spoke with a few women in the field to get their thoughts on the study. As expected, the experiences were varied, though most agreed they had experienced bias.Alexandra Anghel, is CTO and founder of the online platform Appticles, and has more than 10 years' experience as a developer. She's gone gender-neutral on sites like Stack Overflow (a Q&A community for programmers). \"I didn't have a profile photo when creating my account, and, after adding it, I saw that people were not accepting my answers anymore and their comments were becoming meaner and meaner,\" she says in an email.Leslie June, an experienced coder with BitCookie concurs. \"I evade a lot of bias as I stay anonymous whenever I can, but I have certainly experienced the bias in person,\" June says via e-mail.Lookmai Rattana, a developer with two years' experience would agree with that statement. \"The only time I have experienced a gender bias was when I used to attend hackathon events. People seemed to always assume I was the designer/creative of the team, rather than being one of the developers,\" she says via email. \"That some people wouldn't even consider that I might be a developer kinda hurts more than assuming that I'm not good at the job.\"The very nature of coding might be partly to blame for this ladies-second attitude. \"Coding itself has a competitive aspect that isn't as present in other industries. While many businesses rely on the communal efforts of a team, coding is very personal, independent, isolating work,\" June explains. Plus, \"the perception that coding is a male-dominated industry is still pervasive, which leads to gender bias in and out of the community.\"But software engineer Priscilla Rodriguez doubts that the bias issue is as dire as some believe. \"In my opinion other industries are way harder on female workers than in coding,\" she emails. \"Other professional industries often give preferential treatment to men over women, but in my experience, coding has [a] pretty even playing field.\"Interestingly, it's not clear whether men are always the problem portion of the equation. \"In the present paper, we haven't looked at the gender of the person responding to the pull request,\" researcher and North Carolina State associate professor of computer science, Emerson Murphy-Hill, notes. \"We've done some preliminary analysis on that, and it looks like women are harder on women, and men are harder on men. But this analysis doesn't take into account whether the genders are visible.\"Several of the female developers pointed out that the answer to the problem is for more women to enter the field so it won't be so surprising to see a female coder, or accept suggestions from her.\u00a0\"The more women in the field, the less shocking it will be to anyone, and the more normalized it will become. Just like doctors \u2014 no one is surprised by a female doctor anymore,\" emails Ann Gaffigan, CTO for National Land Realty. \"I do think the answer is for us to be confident in our work, and to not apologize for being female.\"\u00a0Groups like Girls Who Code and Black Girls Code encourage more women to join the STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) work force. Girls Who Code cites a disturbing stat \u2013 74 percent of middle school-aged girls are interested in STEM subjects, but a measly 0.4 percent choose computer science majors come college time."},

If a taxpayer forgot to report some freelance babysitting income on last year's return or overlooked some investment income used to pay for home improvements, the IRS could require past-due taxes with interest.Tax experts generally say that it's best to pay this as soon as possible, rather than hope the IRS overlooks it, because the longer a taxpayer waits, the more interest accrues, and the IRS could charge a penalty on top of that. Other times, amending a tax return can benefit a taxpayer and provide a refund from the IRS.Before you begin going over the 1040X form itself, you'll have to determine whether this is the appropriate form for you. We'll then discuss how much time the IRS allows to submit the form. And, although the IRS tries to make this form easy to follow, it can still seem complicated to navigate. Indeed, the IRS estimates that it takes the average taxpayer a full nine hours and an out-of-pocket cost of $160 to complete and submit the form [source: IRS 1040X Instructions]. So, we'll go over the form and the instructions to help you understand them. Finally, you'll have to include all required documentation and make sure to mail it to the right place."},

For the vast majority of workers, it's much more realistic to simply find a job where you can make a good living, and if possible, to make it through each day with a smile on your face. But can you really predict workplace happiness simply by choosing the right industry? While a couple of surveys show recurring themes, the link between happiness and industry can change depending on who you ask.AdvertisementA 2013 survey by Career Bliss which focused on midlevel workers \u2014 not CEOs and low-wage employees, but largely blue- and white-collar workers \u2014 found that the happiest industries included business management, real estate, utilities, educational services, construction, government and finance. Among the unhappiest industries, according to the same survey? Retail, transportation, wholesale trade, hospitality and the arts/entertainment/recreation arena [source: Career Bliss].But a study by Rasmussen College conducted in 2014 offered some conflicting information. Finance, government and business management also ranked at the top of employee satisfaction surveys \u2014 but along with the wholesale trade, hospitality and arts/entertainment/recreation fields Career Bliss had ranked at the bottom of the heap. The difference could lie in demographics, however; while Career Bliss included only midlevel workers, the Rasmussen study was spread across a larger range, including both low- and high-wage employees [source: Erstad].If it's happiness you seek, you may be better off searching based on specific careers, rather than lumping entire industries together. Career Bliss surveys conducted in 2013 [source: Career Bliss] and 2014 [source: Career Bliss] agreed with a British study reported by the BBC in 2014 \u2014 quality assurance is a consistently satisfying career on both sides of the pond [source: Easton].

Consider becoming a real estate agent, sales rep, finance professional, software engineer, construction manager, marketer or controller, all of which seem to come with a side of happiness.Stuck in your current career and need a dose of cheer?

While this sounds like an excellent reason to finally give up on humanity, it's actually a fascinating glimpse into our technological future.At an art auction in May 2018 in New York City, a man paid $140,000 for a digital kitty cat. While this sounds like an excellent reason to finally give up on humanity, it's actually a fascinating glimpse into our technological future.The six-figure cat is what's known as a CryptoKitty. Like Beanie Babies of yore, CryptoKitties are collectibles. But unlike Beanie Babies, there is no fluffy object to hold in your hands. CryptoKitties are entirely digital.AdvertisementThe creators of CryptoKitties are big believers in the potential of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain, the unhackable ledger that records cryptocurrency transactions. But they also understand that people's eyes tend to glaze over when you try to explain how the blockchain works, how cryptocurrencies are mined, what smart contracts are, etc. See, you almost fell asleep!Instead, they decided to create the world's first blockchain-based game inspired by the internet's obsession with cute cat pics. Essentially, they are tricking us into using cryptocurrencies and smart contracts by blinding us with big-eyed kittens.Here's how CryptoKitties works. You start by buying a cat on the CryptoKitties marketplace. Each cat is \"genetically\" unique, meaning that its unique DNA code is stored on the blockchain and cannot be copied or changed. Because each kitty has unique DNA, it also looks different than all other digital cats. Heavier eyelids, thicker fur, perhaps wearing a wizard's robe.Here the creators of CryptoKitties are playing with the idea of digital scarcity. In technical terms, they created a special digital token associated with each cat that is \"non-fungible,\" meaning that it can't be replicated or lumped together with some other assets. No matter how the CryptoKitty is sold or traded, it preserves its unique pedigree on the blockchain.Scarcity, as we learned with Beanie Babies, gives collectibles their value. The more desirable the \"cattributes\" (that's a real word now) of each CryptoKitty, the higher the purchase price. But to buy a CryptoKitty, you first need an online cryptocurrency wallet. The CryptoKitties marketplace runs on the Ethereum platform, so you'll need to buy some ether (that's the cryptocurrency) and stick it in your wallet.If, like me, this is your first time buying cryptocurrency, it's a low-stakes introduction to the technology. Instead of betting your life's savings on the fluctuating price of bitcoin, you're throwing away five bucks on a digital cat that looks slightly drunk (the cheap ones ain't so cute).Once you have a CryptoKitty, the next step is to mate it with another cat and produce more genetically unique digital offspring. (An algorithm determines how it looks or its \"cattributes.\") CryptoKitty owners auction off their most desirable cats as \"sires\" to the highest bidder. The resulting coupling is registered as a smart contract executed on the blockchain, where the offspring's genealogy is recorded for posterity.Several of those auctions have reached six figures with more than $24 million spent on the CryptoKitties marketplace since it launched in November 2017. CryptoKitties pockets 3.75 percent of each transaction.The creators of CryptoKitties didn't expect their digital collectibles to get this hot this fast, but their nefarious plan to get us all playing on the blockchain seems to have worked.Until November 2018 the creators say a new CryptoKitty will be released every 15 minutes. Once they're all gone, the only way to get a new one will be to breed two others or buy one from another user."},

While most of the people in Thailand practice Buddhism, there is also a sizeable Muslim population, in addition to Christians, Hindus and others. Over the years, Thai people have borrowed bits and pieces from each other's practices and backgrounds to create new cultural and social traditions.Napha Phyakul Quach's wedding reflects some of Thailand's ethnic and cultural mix. She was married by an imam in a Muslim ceremony and wore her Indonesian mother's wedding dress -- a batik sarong. Her husband, who is Chinese, wore a traditional Chinese gown. The ceremony incorporated the Chinese, Indonesian and Thai tradition of the groom's procession to the bride's house; the groom passed through the series of symbolic \"gates\" to reach her home.AdvertisementIn Thailand, the pageantry of a wedding focuses primarily on the groom, who makes his way to the bride in a procession that is often accompanied by music. Friends and relatives of the groom, bearing food and gifts such as silver, gold, jewelry and cash, join in the procession. \"The procession to the bride's house is the most exciting part of the wedding,\" Phyakul Quach observes. On his way, the groom passes through the \"silver gate\" and the \"gold gate,\" which consist of string or chains made of silver or gold that are held at each end by young children. The groom pays a token fee -- more for the gold gate than the silver one -- to the children, who then \"open\" each gate so he can reach the bride.The Thai wedding ceremony is held during the day at the bride's home and is generally fairly small, attended only by family and close friends. It is usually followed by a large evening reception at a hotel or party room, complete with food, music and entertainment. At a Buddhist ceremony, monks are invited to the wedding to chant prayers and are presented with alms and food by the couple. The bride and groom kneel together, and a sacred thread is draped from one head to the other, forming a circle and connecting the couple. They each clasp their palms together in the traditional prayer-like gesture called wai, and one by one the guests pour a conch shell full of sacred water over the couple's hands while saying a blessing for good luck. Guests then present their gifts to the newlyweds, either by placing an envelope containing money into a nearby basket or giving a gift.The groom's family is responsible for the bride's dowry, a sum that is often negotiated between the two families. The dowry may be displayed, before the ceremony, as a pile of cash to indicate that the groom is a good catch. After the ceremony, the money is generally given to the new couple to help them start their lives together.To choose the date of the wedding, a couple will usually go to the temple where they worship and consult with a monk, who will determine a lucky day for the marriage, explains Prama Mong, information officer for the Tourism Authority of Thailand. The date is usually chosen by considering the birth dates of the bride and groom and by factoring in lucky days and the phases of the moon.Thai brides don't have a standard wedding dress but tend to wear a traditional, close-fitting, brightly colored Thai silk ensemble during the wedding ceremony. It is often adorned with gold jewelry encrusted with semiprecious stones. White is growing in popularity, and some brides opt for a Western-style wedding gown at the evening reception. Black is never worn -- and should not be worn by guests -- as it is considered to be bad luck and the color of mourning.Thai women take their husband's last name, but ethnic Chinese women do not, explains Phyakul Quach. She notes that in Thailand, last names are unique to each family. Her paternal grandfather and grandmother, for instance, created Phyakul by taking sounds of their Indonesian and Chinese first names and creating a Thai name that would be unique to their family. And while she has taken her husband's last name - Quach - her children use the name Quach Phyakul to reflect their Thai heritage."},

They have some practical benefits, too, like eating the bugs that eat your plants. Providing birds with a home is a great way to attract them to your yard and encourage them to stay. But instead of buying a pre-made bird house, you can make one easily and inexpensively from a variety of recycled materials.Making a recycled bird house is a great family activity. But before you even begin gathering materials to construct one, you need to decide what type of bird you want to attract. Some birds, like robins and barn swallows, prefer an open nesting shelf to an enclosed house. Cavity nesters -- birds who'll move into a bird house -- include owls, swallows, ducks, bluebirds, purple martins, wrens and prothonotary warblers. The species of bird will determine the size of the house and entrance hole, where to drill the entrance and how high to mount the bird house.AdvertisementNow, no bird carries around a tape measure when it's house hunting. It's unlikely any bird will reject your housing offer because it's an inch too big or slightly out of square. But it's good to keep in mind that different birds have different size requirements and aesthetic preferences.\u00a0For example, bluebirds like to nest 4-6 feet (1.2-1.8 meters) above the ground in a box that's about 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) square and 8-12 inches (20-31 centimeters) tall. They need a small entrance hole, about 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) in diameter, and prefer it to be high on the box. If you want to attract a barn owl, however, you'll need a substantially bigger and taller rectangular box and a 6-inch diameter (15-centimeter) entrance hole that's near the bottom of the bird house, and you'll want to mount it 12-18 feet (3.7-5.5 meters) above the ground [source: Kress, Recycled Bird House Company].How you mount the bird house is also important. Some birds don't mind hanging houses, but plenty of others want stability in the wind. Nailing the house to a tree is an option, but it damages the tree. A mounting post allows you to put the nesting box where you can see it. You can use wooden or metal posts, or PVC pipe. You can assemble PVC to telescope for cleaning ease. It's hard for squirrels and cats to get a grip on PVC pipe, too.\u00a0"},

With the rise of ever-higher-definition streaming video that you can load up just about any time and in any place, it's probably safe to assume that there are not a ton of folks still lugging around a library of VHS tapes and the clunky equipment you need to play them. The move to more modern forms of television and movie viewing may have left videocassette recorders (VCRs) primed for burial long ago, and\u00a0the final nail in the coffin is coming by the end of July\u00a0\u2014 that's when the only manufacturer known to still be making the box-shaped tape players will roll the last ones off of its assembly line.Funai Electric says its VCRs simply became too expensive to make, as parts for the machines have become more difficult to secure. Still, the company churned out 750,000 analog tape players last year. (Mathematically, that's about 749,999 more than many people would have assumed.) Although the video-viewing masses have moved on to other mediums to catch shows and flicks, a vibrant community of VHS tapeheads remains around the globe.AdvertisementFunai's decision isn't likely to sit well with VHS diehards, whose preference for analog tapes in many ways mirrors the recent resurgence of vinyl records. Some obscure tapes \u2013 especially those never released in other formats \u2014 go for big bucks on the trading market. The end of Funai's production run could create a similar market for old VCRs that still work well, and demand for tech tinkerers who can get busted ones up and running again.If you're looking for another obscure video format to turn to, you can also wander over to the digital video disc (DVD) market. New movies and shows are still get DVD releases, Netflix still sends them out to subscribers via mail and you can even wander in to a Target or Best Buy to scoop them up.

"], "date": "Updated: Feb 11, 2021", "content": "Spoiler alert: if you really love your pricy flat-screen TV, with its brilliant colors and perfect contrast, stop reading \u2014 because we don't want to ruin it for you. But for those of you who are intrigued by the inner workings of your high-tech television and wonder why images may look just a bit grayish sometimes, this story's for you. This is commonly called the dirty screen effect and to varying degrees it's evident in every flat-screen LED/LCD and plasma TV on the market.Dirty screen effect, or DSE to TV geeks, refers to a lack of uniformity in solid colors displayed on LED/LCD and plasma televisions. A vast majority of TV watchers will never notice this lack of uniformity, which is visible mostly in specific circumstances: during moments of bright colors or whites (such as during snowy white or desert scenes), or when the screen should look entirely black or gray but instead shows uneven, cloudy splotches and sometimes stripes or banding.When the screen displays mostly bright white, you may see that it almost looks dirty, with splotchy areas of gray. The cloudy appearance isn't readily apparent to casual viewers, and it's almost unnoticeable when the scene changes to more dynamic images.AdvertisementHow much DSE you see depends partly on the model you purchased. Pricier models generally feature improved better uniformity, mostly because manufacturers use more rigorous quality standards for their high-end products. But, no matter how much you spend, uniformity is unique to every individual unit, meaning you don't really know how much DSE you're getting until you see it in person.Is your obsessive side getting twitchy yet? Before we discuss upping your Xanax prescription, let's review how the DSE demon begins its possession of your beloved screen.If you own a plasma TV, the pixels are individually illuminated and all capable of achieving the same level of brightness. This tends to make DSE less visible in these devices, particularly in high-end models.Still, DSE may afflict cheaper versions, particularly if the anti-reflective coating on the glass that overlays the screen is of low quality or poorly applied. Furthermore, as the display ages, the phosphors in the screen may begin to wear out or malfunction, all of which can contribute to less uniform images, which is often apparent particular in scenes with fast panning shots.In LCD and LED TVs, DSE is typically a bigger issue, one that's due to the way these units are illuminated. Before we proceed, it's worth mentioning that although marketing-speak often treats LED and LCD TVs as completely different technologies, they're not different beasts.LED units could be more accurately described as \"LED-backlit LCD televisions,\" but salespeople and consumers alike are too lazy to utter that tongue-wearying phrase while haggling in a big-box store. What's important to realize is that both categories rely on LCDs (liquid crystal displays), which act as shutters that either block light or allow it to pass, depending on the image that's being rendered on the screen.There are a variety of factors that affect LCD quality, notably illumination source. Older LCD TVs, for example, used multiple cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFL) to light LCDs from the rear. They provide generally smooth and even illumination, but they make the final product rather bulky.More modern TVs rely on LEDs (light-emitting diodes) as a light source. Some models have what's called full-array backlighting, in which the LEDs are stationed in regular intervals behind the screen, creating even lighting and excellent picture quality.Other models incorporate what's called edge lighting, which positions the LEDs along the edges of the screen. In general, the overall picture quality isn't quite as good as a backlit screen, but manufacturers still use it because it allows them to build substantially slimmer TVs.Regardless of the lighting source, sometimes it's not the technology itself that results in DSE. It might be due to the way the display was handled at the factory or even en route to your home.If you've ever pressed a little too hard on your smartphone or computer screen, you've likely witnessed a bit of discoloration, clear evidence of how sensitive LCDs are to physical pressure. Now, picture a huge manufacturing facility that cranks out thousands of these units per week. It's easy to see how a bit of mishandling could alter the screen's consistency.The same goes for shipping. Some units travel long distances in cargo boxes, and then take bouncy rides in your car to their final resting place on your living room wall. That's a lot of opportunities for tiny mishaps to affect LCD uniformity.AdvertisementRegardless of the cause of uniformity problems, in most cases there isn't much you can do to combat DSE that appears on LED TVs. Some people have been known to return or exchange multiple copies of the same TV, hoping to finally score one with fewer, less noticeable uniformity issues. Sometimes their persistence is rewarded; sometimes those obsessive efforts are in vain.Before you go to those extremes, it's worth tinkering with the various display modes to see if they help. For instance, if you do a lot of gaming, be sure to set the screen mode to \"Gaming\" or similarly named preset to squeeze the best performance from your TV. Same goes for movies or other specific purposes.Further trial and error may also improve your circumstances. Some TVs are equipped with variable brightness controls. If your viewing room is very dark, you may benefit from turning down the display's brightness. You might also find that installing bias lighting behind the TV helps to minimize the annoyances of DSE. Alternately, in very bright rooms, cranking the brightness to max might be your best bet.Viewing angle also matters. If your screen is tilted away from your eyes, or if it's not at eye level, you're more likely to see vignetting or blotchiness.Lastly, once in a while in online forums, users will complain of a hazy effect that they see when watching their favorite movies. In some cases, there's nothing wrong with the product at all. There's literally too much dust on the screen.If you happen to fall into this filthy category, follow your manufacturer's recommendations for cleaning the screen, and be glad for such an easy solution. If only all of our technology problems could be wiped away like so much dirt.The so-called \"5 percent gray test\" is a standard that many videophiles use to judge TV screen uniformity. You can load this one via YouTube and test your own TV, but be forewarned, once you see quality issues with your TV, you may not be able to unsee them.Originally Published: Sep 24, 2019"},

You'll connect it to the internet or a tuner of some kind (or both), add Blu-ray players or video-game consoles (or both), and go through the configuration process to get the sound and picture the way you like them.Before you start enjoying your brand-new television, you've got to get it set up the way you want it. You'll connect it to the internet or a tuner of some kind (or both), add Blu-ray players or video-game consoles (or both), and go through the configuration process to get the sound and picture the way you like them.But videophiles know that TV pictures can be fine-tuned to the standards used by film producers to give a more authentic picture, the way the director intended it to look.\"They want the colors of the scenery to be the same as they were during filming and they want shadow detail to be the same,\" says Charles Cooper, a calibration expert certified by the Imaging Science Foundation (ISF), Home Acoustics Alliance (HAA), Sencore and THX and owner of Cinetune in Johns Creek, Georgia. \"If a famous movie director walked into your home, and they turned off the lights and watched their movie, you would want that movie director thinking, 'Yeah, this is what this is supposed to look like.'\"You may wonder why TVs don't come preset from the factory to display their most accurate picture, but there's a very simple reason. \"A manufacturer's drive is to sell TVs, and marketing departments understand their product must vie for attention against competitors on an ultra-bright sales floor,\" Cooper says. \"Ultimately, everyone attempts to grab attention by exaggerating color and contrast and making the picture much brighter than would normally be optimal under typical home lighting.\"When you bring your brand-new TV home, you may watch a movie you'd seen in the theater and notice that it looks entirely different using the TV's default setting than it did on the big screen. You can change that through calibration. Although none of your TV's picture modes built in to your display will likely be entirely accurate when you pull it out of the box, there's usually one mode that's closer to the others. Each manufacturer has its own name for this mode, although most call it something like \"cinema,\" \"movie\" or \"theater\" mode. Despite its name, Cooper says, this mode is accurate for all types of content from sports and sitcoms to Hollywood masterpieces. Producers create and capture content using displays calibrated to industry professional standards.If you want to want to improve upon your TV's default settings, you can hire a professional TV calibrator, or opt for the less-expensive option and do some of the work yourself, using Blu-ray setup discs or software with test patterns. THX also offers a smartphone app designed to help you calibrate your TV. Here are some other tips:AdvertisementThis will be the \"movie\" or \"cinema\" mode, or whatever name your TV's manufacturer gave it. Then, check the owner's manual to learn about your specific display before you start adjusting other settings. \"Different manufacturers use the same terms to mean different things,\" Cooper says. For example, the \"brightness\" setting may control the display's backlight or it could adjust the black level in the picture, two very different things.AdvertisementIn your search bar, type something like \"calibration settings\" along with your TV's make and model to see what the experts advise. Reputable tech sites such as CNET, Rtings, or Vincent Teoh's HDTVTest are good sources of this information. Copying the settings they suggest will ensure your TV image is not overscanned (meaning the image has not been cropped by your TV) and that the picture quality is fine-tuned.That said, don't change the color gamut calibration and grayscale settings. \"Without professional equipment, you're better off leaving those on the default setting as each TV off the assembly line will vary too much to make these useful,\" Cooper says. \"But if the 'movie' picture mode is correct on an identical model TV from a reputable site, it's likely going to be correct on yours. A calibration DVD should help steer you toward the portion of the TV's display that can be adjusted properly without equipment.\" AdvertisementThere's no way for the TV manufacturer to know the environment in which you watch your favorite movies. \"With an LCD TV for example, the manufacturer might set the black level expecting the viewer to sit directly in front of the display. But what happens if that's not the case?,\" says Cooper. \"If you're always watching from an angle, the correct setting for black level may be different.\"Ambient light also makes a significant difference. \"The more ambient light there is, the harder it is to see shadow detail, and colors can become washed out,\" he adds.AdvertisementCalibrating your TV by itself won't account for the signals coming from a particular cable box, streaming internet video or Blu-ray player. \"Often cable boxes are overscanned or set to the wrong resolution, detracting from the sharpest picture possible,\" Cooper says.Most displays Cooper adjusts come from the factory zoomed-in or \"overscanned\" a few percent. Why would the manufacturer choose to scale and soften the image when the TV can show more of the football field razor-sharp without any scaling at all? A very small percentage of lower-budget, often local, broadcasts can have noise at the top of their image. Since most folks won't understand why they're seeing this, TV manufacturers fear the TV will get the blame and get returned to the store.To make matters worse, sometimes cable providers do the same thing to prevent people from calling about a \"defective\" set-top box. Thus, what is likely a pristine image is getting zoomed-in twice to save us from a bit of noise on a very small percent of content. You can fix this problem by going to a setting with a name like \"aspect ratio\" or \"picture size.\" Select an option called \"screen fit\" or \"1:1\" or some other name.With all of these factors to consider, calibrating your home theater system may seem too challenging. But don't give up. Cooper says that as long as you know what factors affect your particular viewing experience and start your calibration using research from sources you can trust, you can make many adjustments that will improve your viewing experience. \"If you put the time in, and you get a disc, and you follow the description for each test pattern, you can do a world of good and get a tremendous value out of just a few basic adjustments,\" he says.Calibration requires patience and a willingness to check your work. Cooper points out that a lot of the controls are interactive so \"fixing\" one setting might change another for the worse. \"Be prepared to go back and forth until the picture is as accurate as you can get it. It can even take professionals hours to get it all just perfect,\" he notes."},

That's why more than 60 million gallons of beer are sold in kegs every year. After all, what better way could there be to move that precious liquid around than in a big, round barrel that can be rolled, stacked and tapped? No need to worry about bottle caps or broken glass; the keg is incredibly durable, requires no cap and is completely recyclable [source: Beer Institute].But what's going on inside a keg? While beer bottles are transparent, kegs reveal nothing of the complex and uneasy chemical truce that's been established in their dark interiors, nor of the technology that makes them work. When we press on the tap of a keg at a party, or when we order up a pint at the bar, we take it for granted that beer will flow forth with just the right proportions of foam, carbonation, coolness and flavor. But the truth is that a great deal of thought has gone into achieving that perfect balance.AdvertisementA keg is a fancy version of your basic barrel. In the factory, a sheet of stainless steel is rolled into a cylinder and welded together. Then, at the cylinder's midpoint, a set of ribs is pressed into it for added rigidity. Next, top and bottom steel plates are stamped out and likewise welded into place. The steel in question, a particular alloy of chromium, nickel, manganese and several other elements, is used because it welds cleanly leaving a smooth joint -- this is very important for a food-grade container because you don't want any rough surfaces where bacteria can set up shop. [source: nickelinstitute.org]The airtightness of a keg is incredibly important -- it's what keeps the beer from becoming flat and flavorless. Still, the beer has to come out somewhere, and that's why there's a spear. The spear is a long metal tube that reaches almost to the bottom of the keg. Despite its warlike name, the spear is basically a big metal straw through which beer can travel up from the bottom of the keg and out through the tap at the top [source: nickelinstitute.org].Just what are taps, and why do English and American brews refuse to come out of the same ones? We'll get to that in a bit. Right now, let's find out why all kegs are not created equal.\u00a0"},

For the past eight years, we've been able to watch every single tournament game live on TV, thanks to the people at CBS and Turner Sports, who are shelling out more than $1 billion a year for the right to pummel us with endless commercials and Charles Barkley bromides.AdvertisementThere's the internet. (There's always the internet.) And radio. And those newspaper thingies.But for those on the cutting edge, the early adopters, there's also this:Virtual reality. It's real. Right now. Albeit in its own, sometimes still-clunky way.Turner, CBS and the NCAA have teamed up again with Intel True VR to give a bunch of tournament games the VR treatment. It takes a little hardware, and an app. But it's not that difficult to do.And, oh, yeah. You'll need money, too. The app is free to download, but games are $2.99 each, or $19.99 for the rest of the VR tournament. That includes Sweet 16, Elite 8, Final Four and National Championship.Last year's VR technology used seven Intel pods containing 12 cameras each. The camera pods were placed under both baskets, pointed across each free throw line and along the sidelines; one higher pod covered the entire court. The result of all that technology gave VR viewers an immersive \u2014 if not exactly 360-degree \u2014 March Madness experience. Users could even choose their viewpoint from various angles (mid-court, under the basket, etc.) with their headset's controller. This year's VR experience is likely to be similar, if not better.If you haven't used VR, it works like this: After you make sure you're connected to the internet, get the app working right, strap the bulky headset to the front of your face and pick your game, you wait for tipoff, select an angle and move your head. It's that simple.You want to follow the players, you move your head. You want to check out the loudmouth in the second row, you stare at him or her. During a timeout, you want to watch the coach or the cheerleaders ... your choice. You want to change your viewpoint \u2014 in effect, switching VR seats \u2014 you click your controller.You want to look at your watch? Not so easy. Your arm's not there. Again, that's how VR works.The VR games are fully produced just for this \u2014 they're not jacked-up versions of what's on TV \u2014 and are complete with arena sounds and commentary from announcers dedicated to the VR broadcast, including Spero Dedes, Steve Smith, Rich Waltz and Steve Lavin. The games include highlights (in 2-D and VR) and recaps, too, plus behind-the-scene access, and coach and player interviews.The end result of this still-fledgling technology may or may not be the future of sports broadcasting. With billions being spent and billions to be made, though, Turner and CBS aim to find out.Among the other doo-dads that Intel brings to March Madness is something called Intel True View, which uses a series of high-definition cameras throughout the arena to create what is essentially a multi-angle replay. Hoops fans know the tech: A replay of a player dunking, viewed from the other end of the court, can be stopped and the viewpoint swung around, mid-replay, to show the player from the front as he slams the ball through the hoop.

Wouldn't that be cool?Reading minds is not as far-fetched as you might think. In fact, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have developed a wearable device that can actually verbalize a person's thoughts and allow them to talk to a computer \u2014 without anyone else hearing.AdvertisementThe device, dubbed AlterEgo, allows a person to control a computer and ask it questions without ever uttering one word. When the individual wearing the device thinks of a word or a phrase but does not speak it, AlterEgo picks up the neuromuscular signals in that person's jaw and face. AlterEgo transmits those signals to a computer, which is programed to associate them with specific words.Researchers describe AlterEgo as an \"intelligence-augmentation\" device, or IA for short. A person slips the mechanism over their ear and jaw, similar to a headset that performers wear on stage. Inside the device are four electrodes that touch the person's skin. Those electronic devices are so sensitive that they pick up the subtle neuromuscular signals created when a person internally verbalizes words or phrases, a concept known as subvocalization. The device then sends those signals to a computer, which responds by sending a message back to the device.AlterEgo is equipped with a vibrating bone-conduction speaker that rattles the bones of the person's face to the inner ear allowing that person to hear the computer's response. For example, if you're walking down the street and want to know the time, all you have to do is ask in your head and the computer will respond. AlterEgo can also help a person play chess and perform other simple tasks.The device is fairly accurate. In a 10-person trial, AlterEgo had a 92 percent transcription accuracy. Researchers say that number will increase over time. \"Our idea was: Could we have a computing platform that's more internal, that melds human and machine in some ways and that feels like an internal extension of our own cognition?\" Arnav Kapur, a graduate student at the MIT Media Lab told a writer for MIT News.So what effect could this have on communication? AlterEgo can change the way humans interact with computers, allowing us to silently connect with AI assistants such as Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant or Apple's Siri without anyone knowing. If a person is having a conversation and wants to look up a bit of information, they don't have to take out their digital device; instead they can just think of the query. AlterEgo will answer without interrupting the conversation. The device can also help people communicate with their voice in noisy situations, such as on a factory floor or on the deck of an aircraft carrier.Every time you think of a word, phrase or are even reading a book, the process of subvocalization is at work. That means your brain is sending signals to the muscles of your face and throat that will ultimately shape words for you to speak."},

And these watches are not cheap. At an August 2019 Sotheby's auction of watches, some Rolexes went for as much as $27,500.That sounds like a lot for a watch \u2014 and it is \u2014 until you learn that about Paul Newman's famous 1968 Rolex Daytona. In 2017, that one-of-a-kind watch sold for $15.5 million. Although that special watch is literally the only one of its kind (and come on, it was once Paul Newman's), its hammer price was indicative of the confluence of factors that have made Rolex in many ways the reigning leader among exclusive watches.AdvertisementFrom its beginning in 1905\u00a0as Wilsdorf & Davis,\u00a0a timepiece distribution company in London, Rolex has evolved into the king of watches, and not just because of its recognizable crown logo. Founded by German watchmaker Hans Wilsdorf, the brand has become synonymous with the idea of success.In \"The Rolex Story,\" author Franz-Christoph Heel details how in the early 20th century, Wilsdorf wanted to design a wristwatch so accurate that it could successfully compete with pocket watches. At that time, wristwatches were thought to be inferior to pocket watches, in accuracy and their ability to withstand the elements. \"Gentlemen were heard to remark that they would sooner wear a skirt as wear a wrist watch [sic],\" George Gordon wrote in \"Rolex 1905-1989.\" But Wilsdorf viewed these weaknesses as opportunities.He developed a line of wristwatches in a variety of styles, and by 1908, had chosen the name Rolex for the brand. In 1910, the Rolex movement \u2014 what makes the watch tick \u2014 was the first in the world to receive the Swiss Certificate of Chronometric Precision, granted by the Official Watch Rating Centre in Bienne.In addition to having a desire for innovation, Wilsdorf was also a gifted salesman and a marketing expert. His concept of using people for testimonials drove early promotion of the brand and is in part responsible for its longevity and current reputation.\"Hans was a marketing genius,\" says Larry Mendel, senior evaluator and watchmaker with Bob's Watches, a preowned Rolex exchange in Newport Beach, California. \"He was literally decades ahead of his time.\" Wilsdorf promoted Rolex as the best of the best. \"He also backed it up. Quality has always been No. 1 for Rolex from the very beginning.\"AdvertisementIn 1920, Wilsdorf, who by then had relocated to Geneva, Switzerland, separated from Davis and renamed the company Montres Rolex S.A.. He set about to \"perfect the wristwatch,\" according to Heel, including developing one that was waterproof.In a promotional stunt that would have made the father of public relations Edward Bernays proud, Wilsdorf proved the waterproof nature of the new Rolex Oyster by getting one on the wrist of Mercedes Gleitze for her swim across the English Channel in 1927. After 10 hours in the water, the watch was in \"perfect working order.\"Wilsdorf followed this coup with a full, front-page advertisement on the Daily Mail. These types of endorsements by athletes and celebrities have served as a strategy for Rolex ever since, contributing to the brand's success.Rolex has continued to innovate, according to Eric Wind, vintage watch dealer and collector with Wind Vintage in West Palm Beach, Florida. The brand was an early pioneer in the self-winding watch movement, and in the late 1930s, it began offering the iconic Oyster and Jubilee bracelets. Taking the focus off leather and crocodile straps seems a prescient decision considering today's casual fashion.AdvertisementOwning a Rolex watch might be a status symbol, but they are not the most expensive watches by far. At the same August 2019 Sotheby's auction where Rolex offerings topped out at $27,500, a Patek Philippe watch commanded $68,750.\"[Rolex is a] luxury watch for the common man,\" Mendel says. And yet, Rolex is king. The combination of the marketing, the logo being a crown and the quality creates \"a perfect storm to bring everything together to give them that title and keep them there.\"Aside from not being priciest, Rolex watches also might not keep the best time (although they are among the best). In fact, a $15 watch from Target will do that just fine, but that isn't a Rolex.\"Does it keep time better? No,\" says Mendel. \"It goes back to the mindset of that luxury owner. Will it last longer? Absolutely.\"So yes, other watches might be more expensive, and a quartz watch or a smartphone will offer timekeeping accuracy, but that's not the point. Rolex dominates the market, says Paul Altieri, founder and CEO of Bob's Watches, because the quality is guaranteed.\"They are affordable luxury compared to some other brands,\" he says. \"It's Swiss engineering at its best. They are very well made.\"A Rolex watch will also hold its value for decades \u2014 not the case for that Target watch or an iPhone \u2014 and even offer buyers an investment for their money. While demand for Rolexes has increased, supply remains flat. The company makes fewer than 1 million watches a year globally.\"It puts pressure on prices,\" Altieri says. Limiting supply also means there is a two- or three-year waiting list for some new releases, or possibly even longer.AdvertisementNow back to how Rolex became associated with the coolest of the cool. Author Ian Fleming wore a Rolex Explorer, and his character James Bond favored the brand too. A vintage Rolex Submariner 6538 featured in some of the Sean Connery Bond films sold by Worthy for $60,000 in 2016. However at the August Sotheby's auction, the same watch, valued between $180,000 and $280,000, appears not to have sold.In cases like these, the cachet of a celeb association ups the cost. And in one famous case, that cachet drove the price tag up to $17.8 million ($15.5 million plus the buyer's premium, a percentage that must be paid by the buyer to the auction house in addition to the seller's commission fee). We're talking about the Paul Newman \"Paul Newman Daytona\" Rolex we mentioned earlier. When it was purchased at Phillips auction house in New York in 2017, it became the priciest wristwatch ever sold at auction. Dubbed the Paul Newman Daytona because the actor wore it while racing cars, just a few thousand were made. (You can watch the auction bidding here.)\"I think we were all shocked,\" Altieri says, who was in the audience at the auction. The opening bid was $10 million. \"There's only one Paul Newman Paul Newman.\" The seller, James Cox, received the watch as a gift from Newman and donated a portion of the funds from the sale to the Nell Newman Foundation.There, of course, have been other watches that have sold for more. In 2014, a Patek Philippe Supercomplication pocket watch went for more than $24 million at a Sotheby's auction in Geneva. The Chopard 201 Carat with 800 diamonds fetched $25 million, and the Graff Diamond Hallucination is priced at $55 million.But the rugged Rolex is made to be worn, not just admired. \"They are very durable,\" Mendel says. \"They are tool watches.\" Wilsdorf created them for a purpose \u2014 diving, racing, traveling and other active endeavors.Whether selected for a specific use or just for the style, everyone seems to have a favorite, and the brand continuously innovates.Mendel notes the updated \"Batman\" GMT, now on a Jubilee Bracelet, calling it \"one of the hottest new watches that Rolex has put out in 20 years.\" But his personal favorite is the Milgauss, which can withstand magnetic fields of up to 1,000 gauss \u2014 those are the units that denote the strength of a magnetic field. It was designed for scientists.For Wind, he says the Rolex of the moment is the \"Pepsi\" GMT-Master II, which boasts a blue and red 24-hour rotatable bezel. An earlier blue and red version was introduced in the 1950s, but before that, the bezel was always black and red, leading to the nickname \"Coke.\" The new Pepsi retails for $9,200, if you can get one. Because of wait lists and limited supply, some Rolex watches can immediately trade for more than their retail value.But getting into the Rolex game doesn't have to mean years of waiting and spending many thousands of dollars. Preowned Rolex watches from a reputable dealer that have been thoroughly inspected, restored and polished can be bought for as low as $2,000 to $3,000. You might even find a little lady's cocktail watch for around $1,000.Plus, in addition to being among the coolest of the cool, you can watch your watch's value increase as time passes.Before his death, Wilsdorf created the Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, which owns all Rolex companies and is recognized as a charitable trust in Switzerland. That means Rolex is basically a nonprofit."},

You might also be cutting yourself off from new friends and new experiences.AdvertisementWhether you room with someone you've known for years, someone you've messaged with for a few weeks, or someone you don't meet until you lug your belongings into the dorm, it's important to set ground rules -- in writing. Many colleges provide a workbook or roommate agreement form for you and your roommate to fill out. Talk about things frankly.

But what many people don't know is that the patent for another amazing communications tool \u2013 the fax machine \u2013 was filed by a Scottish clockmaker named Alexander Bain three decades earlier.That's right, fax machines predate even rudimentary telephones. And with cockroach-like survivability that makes very little sense from an evolutionary standpoint, the fax machine lives on, beeping and wheezing up sheets of paper the world over. The question is ... why?AdvertisementTo understand, it helps to a know a bit about the facsimile machine's place in history. Although the technology had been around for decades, it wasn't until the 1939 New York World's Fair that fax machines first seized mainstream recognition in the United States. There, attendees stood slack-jawed in amazement as they viewed images and text arriving from around the world at 18 sheets per minute.The machines were simply too expensive for everyday use, though. Even in 1982, one standalone fax machine sold for a whopping $20,000, far too pricey even for most businesses, much less individual consumers. It wasn't until later in the 1980s that the cost of the machines dropped to a point that businesses and home offices found them useful, notably for documents that required legal signatures.Copied signatures, as you can probably guess, were a source of controversy for years, as legal professionals argued about the validity of documents that arrived via phone lines. However, as court after court confirmed the validity of faxed signatures, doctors, lawyers, financial gurus, and other professionals began to rely on faxes to transmit paperwork all over the place.Thus entrenched in the workflow and minds of countless millions of people, the late '80s saw a dramatic rise in the number of fax machines. America had only around 300,00 of the contraptions in the middle of the 80s. By 1989, there were more than 4 million. The fax machine's heyday was at hand.The faxing process is one that billions of people have ingrained into their consciousness. Place a signed document on the machine. Punch in the destination phone number. Hit the green button, and minutes later, your paperwork is in the hands of a colleague on the other side of town \u2013 or on the other side of the continent. As long as the fax machine has paper, the cartridge is not out of ink and nothing has gotten stuck in the transmission process.In the mid-1990s, another history-changing technology exploded in use \u2013 the internet, which provided people with ways to instantly send text, pictures and documents, without the use of paper. With the advent of widespread email, it seemed that fax machines were doomed.Only, they weren't.A 2017 study from IDC showed the four major industries that still use faxing (manufacturing, health care, finance and government) all predicted increased use of faxing over the next two years, averaging a 25 percent increase. So, why's that?Faxing is a familiar technology that people trust. The complexities of the internet and its many offshoot technologies (along with endless headlines about hackers, spyware, viruses and data breaches) create in many people's minds a sense that the Web is not secure.In addition, government policies still encourage faxes. And legal processes, like discovery, lean heavily on paper documents. Doctors fax prescriptions and privacy documents and patient records.Fax machines are a habit. And it's a habit that dies hard, because it's a simple, low-tech, interoperable system that anyone can use with just a few minutes of training.Also, fax machines, like hardy, pesticide-resistant roaches, are evolving with the times. The people surveyed by IDC said the biggest reason for the increase in faxing was that faxing was now integrated with email (as digital faxing) and so was easier to use.\"I fax office notes, prescriptions, lab data, orders and consultation requests. I will fax anything else that is requested,\" says Todd Johnson, a doctor at Access Family Medicine in Lincoln, Nebraska. \"I would email just as easily, but I don't have a general email account to send the requested information to typically. Usually I am only provided with a fax number to return the requested information.\"Johnson says the newest generation of digital faxing makes his workflow fairly easy.\"All of my faxing is digital. I don't use a feed and fax paper machine,\" he says in an email interview. \"I can fax from any of my computers, tablet, or smartphone. I use them because I am requested to use them by other facilities, they are easy to use, built into my EHR software, and now electronically configured into my phone system (I just drag and drop a PDF into the fax portal and away it goes).\"If that sounds too good to be true, never fear, there's still one old-school faxing bugaboo at hand: busy signals.\"Sometimes, but rarely, there is a busy signal. However, my system will resend a failed fax or if it encounters a busy signal.\"In spite of the intermittent hiccups in faxing, the machines are likely to live on for decades. They are comfortable, cheap, convenient and generally reliable. They're accepted around the world in ways that digital signatures sometimes are not.So, until digital alternatives find the same kind of universal recognition, you can expect that fax machines will still be here, beeping and whirring even in the ashes of a great apocalypse.Fax is big in Japan. Even today, about half of Japanese families use a fax machine in their homes."},

He and a bunch of his buddies from Elmhurst, Ill., took an old 1937 Plymouth out to an abandoned field and cranked it around in circles. The object of this teenage prank was to see who could flip the automobile first. Lorenzen claimed he was the first to achieve the dubious goal.The speed game was already under Lorenzen's skin, and within a few years, he was gaining a reputation around short tracks in Illinois. He made a brief stab at NASCAR racing in 1956, but his operating funds ran out after competing in just seven races. Lorenzen went back home broken but undaunted. He graduated up stock car racing's ladder and began running some USAC stock car events in the Midwest.AdvertisementSuccess came virtually overnight. Lorenzen won the USAC Stock Car championship crown in 1958 and '59. \"In my best year, I won $14,000, a trophy, and a gold watch,\" said Lorenzen. \"It was not taking me where I wanted to go.\"NASCAR Image GalleryIn 1960, Lorenzen moved south and took up residence in a tiny trailer in a friend's backyard near Charlotte, N.C. He accepted a job with the famous Holman-Moody Ford team as a mechanic, but was restless in that role and quit. \"I was bull-headed,\" said Lorenzen. \"That was one of my problems. I thought I could make all the money myself by forming my own team.\"Lorenzen made 10 NASCAR Grand National starts in 1960, winning $9,136. Near the close of the season, Lorenzen sold his car and headed back to Elmhurst. He was out of racing, hungry, disgusted, and \u00addiscouraged.On Christmas Eve 1960, Moody phoned Lorenzen and asked him if he was interested in becoming the lead driver on his team. \"I was really surprised,\" said Lorenzen. \"I couldn't imagine what I had done to impress them. I'm sure a lot of people thought they were crazy to hire me.\"In his second start with the Holman-Moody team at Martinsville in 1961, Lorenzen claimed his first career \u00advictory. He followed that up with a highly charged triumph in Darlington's Rebel 300, beating old master Curtis Turner in a late-race duel. Lorenzen went on to win three of his 15 starts in '61, then won twice in 19 races in '62.By 1963, Ford Motor Co. was back in racing, financing a fleet of cars on the NASCAR Grand National trail. Lorenzen hit stride, winning six races in 29 starts and finishing third in the final points standings, despite starting a shade more than half the races. He amassed winnings that totaled $122,588 and became the first driver to earn more than $100,000 in a single season.Statistically, Lorenzen's most productive season was 1964 when he won half of his 16 NASCAR Grand National starts. Mechanical problems kept him out of the hunt in the first four races of his abbreviated season.Following the Daytona 500, however, Lorenzen went on a tear, winning five straight starts. He drove his #28 Holman-Moody Ford to consecutive victories at Bristol, Atlanta, North Wilkesboro, Martinsville, and Darlington. Of the 1953 laps during that five-race stretch, Lorenzen led 1679 of them. It remains one of the most dominating performances over seven weeks in the history of NASCAR.Lorenzen won the Daytona 500 in 1965. He made only five starts in 1967, but after compiling a career record of 26 victories in 129 starts, he suddenly retired from competition, citing ulcers and a loss of weight as reasons for the spur-of-the-moment decision.He played the stock market and remained on the sidelines until May 1970, when the itch returned and he made a comeback attempt. Although he ran up front in a number of races, some of his competitive edge had been lost. By the fall of '72, Lorenzen bowed out for the final time and headed back to Illinois.Herb Nab, who formed a close working relationship with Lorenzen when he was his crew chief, said Fearless Freddy was one of NASCAR's best drivers ever -- if not the very best. \"That's the best driver there is,\" Nab said while pointing to Lorenzen during a lull in the garage area in 1964. \"He can drive a race car better than any of the others, including Fireball Roberts.

Although, yeah, they can be unsettling. And it's not just the ethical dilemma in altering original photos and videos, either. Though that's definitely poking a hornet's nest.Mostly, it's the whole idea that we are rapidly closing in on a point where we simply may not be able to trust our own eyes. Is that photo a true depiction of its subject? Is that video? Does that face go with that body? Do those words go with that face?Can that guy really dance like that?AdvertisementWay back in late 2017, a Reddit user known as Deepfakes, according to Know Your Meme, unveiled some face-swapping pornographic videos \u2014 it's exactly as sad and lame as it sounds; someone's face, often a public figure, superimposed onto someone else's head \u2014 and the deepfakes frenzy began.Shortly after, Deepfakes launched an app, FakeApp, and people jumped all over it. All sorts of memes from that and other programs \u2014 some funny, some just plain creepy, some worse \u2014 have been produced since. They include Nicolas Cage's face on Amy Adams's body (playing Lois Lane in a Superman movie) and a great BuzzFeed production featuring comedian Jordan Peele, as former President Barack Obama, who warns of some of the more possibly sinister uses of the tech in a slightly NSFW video (which ends with the Fauxbama saying, \"Stay woke, bi$%*es!\").The latest deepfake video came courtesy of a TikToker impersonating Tom Cruise. Three videos are shockingly real and show Cruise, among other things, hitting a golf ball. The videos were created by Chris Ume, a visual effects specialist from Belgium. The computer science used to create the programs behind these videos can be extremely complex, much more intense than what is used for simple deepfakes. Intricate algorithms and computer science terms like generative adversarial networks (GAN) and deep neural networks pepper the academic papers of the more advanced video-editing techniques.Generally, what these programs do is examine the video of a subject frame by frame and \"learn\" the subject's size and shape and movements so that they can be transferred to another subject on video. Whereas deepfakes have been limited mainly to swapping out the subjects' faces, the more advanced programs can transfer full 3D head positions, including things like a head tilt or a raised eyebrow or a set of pursed lips. Some work has been done on entire body movements.The more these programs detect, the more variables that these networks are fed and \"learn,\" the more efficient, effective and realistic the videos become.AdvertisementIt's important to note that not all video and photo editing techniques based in artificial intelligence and machine learning are deepfakes. Those in academics who work in the field see deepfakes as amateurish, relegated to mere face-swapping.A group at the University of California Berkeley is working on a technique that takes an entire body in motion \u2014 a professional dancer \u2014 and swaps it onto an amateur's body on video. With a little AI wizardry, then, even someone with two left feet can at least appear to move like Baryshnikov. The Berkeley group detail its work in the paper, Everybody Dance Now.The technique is not perfect, of course. But this is tricky stuff. Even pulling off a computer-generated moving face is difficult. As of now, most AI-generated faces, even on deepfakes \u2014 especially on deepfakes \u2014 are obvious forgeries. Something, almost invariably, seems a little off.\"I think that one thing is the shadow details of the faces,\" says Tinghui Zhou, a grad student in computer science at Berkeley and one of the authors of Everybody Dance Now. \"We [humans] are very good at identifying whether a face is real or not \u2014 the shadow details, how the wrinkles move, how the eyes move \u2014 all those kind of details need to be exactly right. I think the machine-learning system these days is still not able to capture all those details.\"Another new AI video-manipulation system \u2014 or, as its architects call it, a \"photo-realistic re-animation of portrait videos\" \u2014 actually uses one \"source\" actor that can alter the face on a \"target\" actor.You, the \"source\" (for example), move your mouth a certain way, computers map the movement, feed it into the learning program and the program translates it to a video in which Obama mouths your words. You laugh, or raise your eyebrow, and Obama does, too.A paper on that process, known as Deep Video Portraits, was presented at a computer graphics and interactive techniques conference in Vancouver in mid-August 2018, and reveals a place for the program: Hollywood.\"[C]omputer-generated videos have been an integral part of feature-film movies for over 30 years. Virtually every high-end movie production contains a significant percentage of computer-generated imagery, or CGI, from Lord of the Rings to Benjamin Button,\" the authors write. \"These results are hard to distinguish from reality and it often goes unnoticed that this content is not real ... but the process was time-consuming and required domain experts. The production of even a short synthetic video clip costs millions in budget and multiple months of work, even for professionally trained artists, since they have to manually create and animate vast amounts of 3D content.\"Thanks to AI, we can now produce the same imagery in a lot less time. And cheaper. And \u2014 if not now, soon \u2014 just as convincingly.AdvertisementThe process of manipulating existing video, or creating a new video with false images, as comedian Peele and others warn, can be downright dangerous in the wrong hands. Some prominent actresses and entertainers had their faces stolen and weaved into porn videos in the most disturbing early examples of deepfakes. Using images to, as Peele warned with his Obama video, produce \"fake news\" is a very real possibility.Many outlets already have taken steps to stop deepfakes. Reddit, in fact, shut down the subReddit deepfakes. Pornhub vows to ban AI-generated porn. Tumblr and Twitter are among other sites to ban pornographic deepfakes.But these videos might not be particularly easy to police, especially as the programs to create them improve. Michael Zollh\u00f6fer, a computer science professor at Stanford and one of the minds behind Deep Video Portraits, says those in the academic community are aware of the ethics involved. From Zollh\u00f6fer, in a press release announcing his project:Everyone involved in building this technology, Zhou says, needs to take proper steps to ensure it's not misused. Developing software to detect computer-enhanced or altered videos, and marking the video with invisible \"watermarks\" to show, under forensic evaluation, that they're computer-generated, will help. Again, from Deep Video Portraits:Says Zhou: \"I think we, as researchers, we definitely have a responsibility to sort of raise public awareness in terms of the abuse of these technologies. But I want to emphasize: There are many positive uses of this research. We've had requests from dancers to use our research to help their dancing. There are positive aspects of this technology.\"AdvertisementThe field continues to improve as programs become more sophisticated and machines better learn how to overcome the obvious and less-obvious faults in these computer-generated videos and photos. Where it can go is anybody's guess. But many worry improvements in the technology could come so far so fast, we could be entering an era in which we can no longer trust what we see and hear. And that brings us to another type of fake video to be that could also cause major trouble, especially for the upcoming 2020 presidential election: dumbfakes. In May 2019, for example, a distorted video of Speaker Nancy Pelosi spread like wildfire on social media. The video appeared to show Pelosi slur and stumble through a speech. In reality, the video was digitally altered by a sports blogger and \"Trump superfan\" from New York, who then uploaded it Facebook. The video was quickly debunked, but by then it was already viewed millions of times. YouTube removed it saying the video violated its standards. However, Facebook kept it on the site, only saying the video was \"false,\" and that it would try to limit how much it could be shared.While this altered video of Pelosi isn't a technical as a deepfake, Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California, Berkeley, told NPR that's what makes it even more concerning. These are labeled dumbfakes because they're easier and cheaper to producer than deepfakes. Typically it requires changing the speed of the video or basic editing to produce a persuasive new video.  \"The clock is ticking,\" Farid told NPR. \"The Nancy Pelosi video was a canary in a coal mine.\"So many U.S. lawmakers are concerned about this deep fake videos targeting the 2020 U.S. presidential election, that in September 2018, several members of the U.S. Congress to requested a formal report on their technologies and advancements from the Director of National Intelligence.Originally Published: Sep 5, 2018"},

Turing's portrait hangs on the wall behind. ", "Passport photo of Alan Turing, age 16."], "date": "May 22, 2019", "content": "The Turing Test is legendary in the field of artificial intelligence. First proposed by the visionary British mathematician Alan Turing in a landmark 1950 paper, the test provides a practical (and pretty fun) way to determine if a computer has achieved human levels of intelligence. Turing called it \"the imitation game.\" If a computer \u2014 through a text-only chat \u2014 can convince a human that it's a real person, then it passes the test. Simple in theory, but nearly impossible in practice.Turing came up with the imitation game in response to colleagues and critics in the late 1940s who insisted that a machine could never be truly intelligent. But Turing had more faith in these primitive new machines he called \"digital computers.\" That's because Turing was the very first to envision something that we take for granted today \u2014 a single machine that can be programmed to do almost anything. Odds are you're reading this article on just such a machine.AdvertisementAlan Turing was the eccentric British mathematician who came up with the idea of modern computing and whose code breaking played a major role in the Allied victory over the Nazis in World War II. He was prosecuted in 1952 for having a homosexual affair (homosexual acts being illegal in Britain until 1967) and accepted a form of chemical castration as a condition of probation in order to avoid jail time. His security clearance was revoked, ending his work for the British government. He was found dead of cyanide poisoning in 1954 and was posthumously pardoned of his conviction in 2013 by Queen Elizabeth II.Turing was writing about computers well before any such thing existed. Back in 1936, he introduced the concept of the \"universal computing machine\" in a dense mathematical paper called \"On Computable Numbers, With an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem.\"\"According to my definition, a number is computable if its decimal can be written down by a machine,\" wrote Turing, a decade before the first electronic computer was built. \"It is possible to invent a single machine which can be used to compute any computable sequence.\"Turing's definition of \"computability\" \u2014 something that a computer can do \u2014 is what's known today as an algorithm. Turing was the first to lay out the design framework of a machine that could be programmed to run a series of discrete algorithms in order to achieve a desired task. Other mathematicians and engineers had toyed with calculating machines \u2014 most famously Charles Babbage's 19th-century analytical engine \u2014 but Turing envisioned a device that wasn't limited to solving one kind of problem.\"Anything you can describe as an algorithm can be done by one machine,\" says Andrew Hodges, a mathematics professor at Oxford University and author of \"Alan Turing: The Enigma,\" the inspiration for the Oscar-winning 2014 film \"The Imitation Game.\"\"The universal machine is essentially what we mean by a computer now, something on which you can store the instructions and it carries them out,\" says Hodges. \"No one else had formalized that idea.\"AdvertisementFrom the start, Turing's universal machine was conceived as a very simplified form of artificial intelligence, even though that term wouldn't be coined until 1956. Hodges says that the design of the universal machine was meant to imitate the inner workings of the human mind, a subject that fascinated Turing almost as much as mathematics.In fact, when describing how his universal machine would work, Turing used the term \"state of mind\" to label the different \"read\" and \"write\" functions of the machine. In Turing's conceptual machine, a length of tape is run through a read/write scanner. The tape is inscribed with bits of information represented by symbols. The scanner head can either read the symbols or write new ones according to its \"state of mind.\"\"The operation actually performed is determined... by the state of mind of the computer and the observed symbols,\" wrote Turing in his 1936 paper. \"In particular, they determine the state of mind of the computer after the operation is carried out.\"A decade later, when Turing was leading the stalled British effort to build one of the first electronic computers in 1946, he also studied neurology and human physiology on the side. The result was an internal paper published for the National Physical Laboratory that modeled how a computer could be programmed to \"learn\" on its own. Hodges sees it as one of the earliest proposals of what are now called \"neural networks,\" a type of deep machine learning that's at the bleeding edge of artificial intelligence.AdvertisementTuring wasn't the only person intrigued by the similarities between human and machine intelligence. A surge of new technologies developed during World War II, including early computers, space satellites and nuclear power, had captured the intellectual and public imagination.\"As soon as computers are mentioned at all, people are talking about electronic brains and the possibility of the computer rivaling the brain,\" says Hodges.The 1948 book \"Cybernetics\" coined the prefix \"cyber\" and wondered whether it would be possible to \"construct a chess-playing machine, and whether this sort of ability represents an essential difference between the potentialities of the machine and the mind.\" The author, Norbert Wiener, concluded that such a machine \"might very well be as good a player as the vast majority of the human race.\"It was during this era of excitement and nervous speculation about super-intelligent machines that Turing wrote \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence,\" what Hodges calls one of the most cited papers in philosophical literature.Advertisement\"I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines think?'\" begins Turing. Since the definitions of \"machine\" and \"think\" are ambiguous, Turing narrows the scope of the question. For his purposes, the machine must be a \"digital computer\" and the test of whether or not it can \"think\" would be answered by the imitation game.The game, now known as the Turing Test, is only mentioned briefly in the paper and Hodges says that Turing didn't take the details of the test too seriously, publishing different versions in other papers. But Turing did like the playful simplicity of it.\"In a way, he was making a drama out of it,\" says Hodges. It presented this idea [of the possibility of advanced artificial intelligence] in a way that engages people and that ordinary people would make the decision, like a jury in a trial.\"AdvertisementWhen the Turing Test was first published in 1950, Turing himself was confident that \"intelligent machinery\" (as he called it) would be able to win the imitation game within 50 to 100 years. Will his predictions come true?We already have superintelligent computers capable of outwitting the smartest players in other types of games. In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue defeated the reigning chess champion Garry Kasparov, and Watson beat the record-breaking \"Jeopardy!\" champion Ken Jennings in 2011.But the imitation game raises the bar high on artificial intelligence and no computer has come close to convincing ordinary humans that it's one of them. At least not yet. An annual contest called the Loebner Prize conducts its own Turing Tests on the top chatbots to see if the latest AI software can convince a panel of judges that it's more human than its human competitors.None of the chatbots have succeeded. The best performer, a conversational chatbot called Mistuku, has only achieved a rating of \"33-percent human.\" But when I went online to chat with her, I was impressed by her natural-language responses and deep knowledge (albeit probably too deep for a typically dopey human).And when I asked her if a chatbot will ever pass the Turing Test, she had the perfect answer:\"You be the judge of that.\"In addition to being a wildly original thinker in mathematics, philosophy and engineering, Turing was a world-class cross-country runner who may have qualified for the 1948 Olympics if not for an injury."},

Kiger", "image": "https://resize.hswstatic.com/w_828/gif/quantum-internet.jpg", "image_content": ["The future quantum internet would utilize qubits of quantum information, which can take on an infinite number of values. "], "date": "Updated: Feb 11, 2021", "content": "Back in February 2020, scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago revealed that they had achieved a quantum entanglement \u2014 in which the behavior of a pair two tiny particles becomes linked, so that their states are identical \u2014 over a 52-mile (83.7 kilometer) quantum-loop network in the Chicago suburbs.You may be wondering what all the fuss is about, if you're not a scientist familiar with quantum mechanics \u2014 that is, the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scale of reality, which is peculiarly different from the world we can see around us.But the researchers' feat could be an important step in the development of a new, vastly more powerful version of the internet in the next few decades. Instead of the bits that today's network uses, which can only express a value of either 0 or 1, the future quantum internet would utilize qubits of quantum information, which can take on an infinite number of values. (A quibit is the unit of information for a quantum computer; it's like a bit in an ordinary computer).That would give the quantum internet way more bandwidth, which would make it possible to connect super-powerful quantum computers and other devices and run massive applications that simply aren't possible with the internet we have now.\"A quantum internet will be the platform of a quantum ecosystem, where computers, networks, and sensors exchange information in a fundamentally new manner where sensing, communication, and computing literally work together as one entity, \" explains David Awschalom via email. He's a spintronics and quantum information professor in the Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering at the University of Chicago and a senior scientist at Argonne, who led the quantum-loop project.AdvertisementSo why do we need this and what does it do? For starters, the quantum internet is not a replacement of the regular internet we now have. Rather it would be a complement to it or a branch of it. It would be able to take care of some of the problems that plague the current internet. For instance, a quantum internet would offer much greater protection from hackers and cybercriminals. Right now, if Alice in New York sends a message to Bob in California over the internet, that message travels in more or less a straight line from one coast to the other. Along the way, the signals that transmit the message degrade; repeaters read the signals, amplify and correct the errors. But this process allows hackers to \"break in\" and intercept the message.However, a quantum message wouldn't have that problem. Quantum networks use particles of light photons to send messages which are not vulnerable to cyberattacks. Instead of encrypting a message using mathematical complexity, says Ray Newell, a researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory, we would rely upon the peculiar rules of quantum physics. With quantum information, \"you can't copy it or cut it in half, and you can't even look at it without changing it.\" In fact, just trying to intercept a message destroys the message, as Wired magazine noted. That would enable encryption that would be vastly more secure than anything available today.\"The easiest way to understand the concept of the quantum internet is through the concept of quantum teleportation,\" Sumeet Khatri, a researcher at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, says in an email. He and colleagues have written a paper about the feasibility of a space-based quantum internet, in which satellites would continually broadcast entangled photons down to Earth's surface, as this Technology Review article describes.\"Quantum teleportation is unlike what a non-scientist's mind might conjure up in terms of what they see in sci-fi movies, \" Khatri says. \"In quantum teleportation, two people who want to communicate share a pair of quantum particles that are entangled. Then, through a sequence of operations, the sender can send any quantum information to the receiver (although it can't be done faster than light speed, a common misconception). This collection of shared entanglement between pairs of people all over the world essentially constitutes the quantum internet. The central research question is how best to distribute these entangled pairs to people distributed all over the world. \"Once it's possible to do that on a large scale, the quantum internet would be so astonishingly fast that far-flung clocks could be synchronized about a thousand times more precisely than the best atomic clocks available today, as Cosmos magazine details. That would make GPS navigation vastly more precise than it is today, and map Earth's gravitational field in such detail that scientists could spot the ripple of gravitational waves. It also could make it possible to teleport photons from distant visible-light telescopes all over Earth and link them into a giant virtual observatory.\"You could potentially see planets around other stars, \" says Nicholas Peters, group leader of the Quantum Information Science Group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.It also would be possible for networks of super-powerful quantum computers across the globe to work together and create incredibly complex simulations. That might enable researchers to better understand the behavior of molecules and proteins, for example, and to develop and test new medications.It also might help physicists to solve some of the longstanding mysteries of reality. \"We don't have a complete picture of how the universe works,\" says Newell. \"We have a very good understanding of how quantum mechanics works, but not a very clear picture of the implications. The picture is blurry where quantum mechanics intersects with our lived experience.\"AdvertisementBut before any of that can happen, researchers have to figure out how to build a quantum internet, and given the weirdness of quantum mechanics, that's not going to be easy. \"In the classical world you can encode information and save it and it doesn't decay, \" Peters says. \"In the quantum world, you encode information and it starts to decay almost immediately. \"Another problem is that because the amount of energy that corresponds to quantum information is really low, it's difficult to keep it from interacting with the outside world. Today, \"in many cases, quantum systems only work at very low temperatures,\" Newell says. \"Another alternative is to work in a vacuum and pump all the air out. \"In order to make a quantum internet function, Newell says, we'll need all sorts of hardware that hasn't been developed yet. So it's hard to say at this point exactly when a quantum internet would be up and running, though one Chinese scientist has envisioned that it could happen as soon as 2030.Albert Einstein, who questioned the validity of quantum mechanics, called quantum entanglement \"spooky action at a distance,\" as Technology Review explains.Originally Published: Mar 30, 2020"},

"], "date": "Jul 9, 2020", "content": "If you've ever looked into a box of old family pictures and wondered where a particular photo was taken or when, you may appreciate modern digital cameras and smartphones that save all of that information for you. Those details are a digital image's metadata, and although it can be nice to have that information associated with the file, there may be times when you don't want that information attached. The same technology that can help you prove you're the copyright owner creates evidence you were in a particular place at a particular time. And you may not want that info to possibly get into the wrong hands.The metadata associated with a digital image is stored in a format called Exchangeable Image File Format, better known as EXIF. This metadata includes latitude and longitude coordinates for where the picture was taken, date and time it was taken, and camera settings and programs used to edit the photo. Information embedded in a digital image can be even used to prove it was taken with a specific camera or smartphone.AdvertisementIf you'd like to remove that information, here's how:You can do multiple images at the same time by highlighting all photos you want to remove the metadata from at the same time and right-clicking.If you have a MacIf you click on the \"EXIF\" tab rather than the GPS tab, you can see all the metadata but you won't able to remove it. Luckily, there are many third-party tools that can help you removing metadata, particularly useful if you want to purge batches of photos. ExifTool, by Phil Harvey, is a free and open-source option for Windows, Mac, and Linux that will let you edit the metadata on your images. Another popular one is ImageOptim. A web tool called Image Scrubber is a great option for people who need to remove image metadata while they're on the go. Upload the image in your web browser and you can also blur parts of the image or brush parts out. When you download the image back to your phone, it will have any changes you made, and the EXIF information will be stripped, too. Image Scrubber says it doesn't save the photo or any other data when you use it.For iPhonesAndroidIf you want to get rid of all your metadata, you'll need to use a third party app to do that. But location data is generally what most people care about anyway:If you don't want the data on your photo in the first place, open the camera app on your smartphone and find the setting that controls location. There should be a way to disable that location tags. If you turn off the smartphone's GPS before shooting, the data should not be there either. With a digital camera, check the manual or manufacturer's website for info on how to disable the metadata."},

"], "date": null, "content": "Judging from news coverage, it seems as if more and more people across the country want to carry concealed weapons, now that all 50 states have legalized the practice. But as Minnesota entrepreneur and gun enthusiast Kirk Kjellberg notes, a lot of Americans also are uncomfortable with the idea of being around someone who's packing heat. Kjellberg recounted a recent occasion when he went a restaurant for lunch, and a little girl noticed the holstered handgun he was wearing.\"The kid screams out, 'Mommy, mommy, that man's got a gun!'\" he said on a recent episode of the podcast Arms Room Radio, adding that some people gave him the \"stink eye\" afterward as result. \"I thought, God, there's got to be a better way to do this.\"AdvertisementKjellberg's answer was to start a new company, Ideal Conceal, which plans to market later this year what might be the ultimate in surreptitious armament \u2014 a small pistol with a folding grip that's designed to look like a smartphone. That way, a person can carry it clipped to a belt or tucked in a pocket, and no one around him or her will be the wiser.So far, only a plastic model and digital blueprints of the smartphone gun exist, but Kjellberg says he's in the process of having a prototype built and tested, with the aim of going into production in October. Already, based mostly on a few drawings on the company's website and Facebook page, about 5,000 people have expressed an interest in buying the weapon. Recently interviewed\u00a0by phone, Kjellberg says that the potential customers range from real estate agents who don't want to alarm customers, to bodyguards who want to remain inconspicuous in a crowd. \"You don't want people to see you packing a .45,\" he says.Because it sacrifices heft for subterfuge, the smartphone gun isn't the most powerful weapon around. It fires relatively small .380-caliber projectiles and only contains two bullets. But in emergencies, says Kjellberg, \"the best gun is the one you have with you.\"To ensure it won't go off in a user's back pocket, the gun is designed so that it can be fired only when the safety is off and the grip is fully unfolded. Even so, depending upon a user's skill, it should be possible for someone to pull out the smartphone gun and quickly get off a shot or two with just one hand. \"It's designed to happen fast,\" Kjellberg says.But that ability to morph in an instant from an innocuous, commonplace personal accessory into a lethal weapon also has some people worried.\"You can envision a scenario in which police officers are called to the scene where some physical altercation is taking place, \" says Ladd Everitt, director of communications for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, a Washington, D.C.-based organization. \"An officer goes to intercede, and he's not aware that the person he's dealing with is armed, because it looks like an iPhone on his belt.\"Everitt also points to the risk of children being attracted to the novelty of a smartphone gun. \"If you're a parent, you understand how often your kid wants to play with your phone,\" he says. \"This presents a very obvious danger.\"Kjellberg, who counts police officers among his potential customers, doesn't see the smartphone gun as presenting any more of a risk to officers than other sorts of concealed weapons. The gun can't be fired from its phone-like configuration, he notes, and the need to unfold the handle would give officers a moment in which to react. As for the potential for accidental shootings by children, he said that his should be treated like any other gun.\"You've got to keep this stuff locked up,\" he says, \"and be careful when children are around.\"Kjellberg says that because the smartphone gun will contain metal and conventional gun parts, it'll be instantly recognizable to airport scanners and will set off metal detectors in government buildings and other public places as well. He said he's already contacted federal authorities and offered to provide x-rays and blueprints for the weapon to the Transportation Security Administration, which monitors airport checkpoints. (A TSA spokesman declined to confirm that or to otherwise comment.)At a press conference on Monday, April 4, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer spoke out against the gun, saying \"\"Just like toys that too much look like handguns should not be sold, handguns that look too much like toys should not be sold.\"What regulatory hurdles the smartphone gun faces remains unclear. Brian Garner, a special agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, says via email that the bureau would need to examine a prototype of the smartphone gun to decide whether it would be regulated under the National Firearms Act, a 1934 law that requires federal registration for certain types of unusual weaponry, such as machine guns and silencers. Garner said that over the years, ATF has seen a variety of firearms disguised as items such as pens or walking canes, and that there have been previous guns disguised as phones as well.A 2015 study looked at U.S. gun permit data and crime statistics in 500 counties across four states and found no statistically significant correlation between changes in concealed carry licensing and crime rates, including the rates of violent personal crime such as the murder rate and robbery."},

While the design of the YCC is filled with forward-looking ideas, the most innovative aspect of the car is not the design, but who designed it -- an all-woman design team.Unveiled at the 2004 Geneva Auto Show, the YCC is the first concept car to be designed from start to finish by a team composed exclusively of women. Women are a growing market for the Swedish auto maker. According to Volvo, 54 percent of its U.S. buyers are women, and its female customer base in Europe is growing. With women identified as a key market, Volvo handed the drafting pencils over to those who best know what women want from their cars.AdvertisementIn this article, we'll take a look inside Volvo's newest concept car, and see what these designing women produced.The YCC is a two-door sports coupe and is tame by some concept car standards (see the Toyota PM for a more radical concept vehicle). In recent years, Volvo has been rounding off and softening its traditionally boxier design. The YCC continues that trend, and is not far removed from a production design. While not yet ready for production, some of its design elements could soon be adopted in current models.The front end is lower than a traditional Volvo and the fenders are in sight for better road vision. Additionally, the rear window extends to the extremities of the car, and the tail end slants back slightly more than the Volvo S series models. Together, these elements allow the driver to see all four corners of the car's exterior.\"We wanted to create a beautiful car,\" says Anna Ros\u00e9n. \"Not brutal, but tough.\"Most striking when looking at the car from the front is that it doesn't have a hood. The design team determined that their target audience doesn't need to look under the hood. The front section of the chassis can be lifted in a garage, but it does not open like a traditional hood.There are two capless ball-valve filling points, like those of a racing car, that allow the driver to add gasoline and windshield washer fluid. These capless filling points eliminate the need for caps or latches, which were identified as nuisances by most female drivers.Another radical element are the gull-wing passenger doors, which are intended to allow the YCC easier entry. The doors lift up overhead like the rear door of a hatchback. These doors are intended to ease entry into the back seat.Additional exterior features include an Easy-Clean paint that behaves much like the coating on a non-stick cooking pan. Dirt doesn't cling to it as easily, and it washes off with very little effort. The car also features run-flat tires, so that it can be driven a safe distance after a puncture.Now, let's open the YCC's gull-wing driver-side door and step inside to look at the interior."},

The son of a mill worker and one of nine brothers and sisters, Isaac didn't own a pair of shoes until he was 13. Lacking parental supervision, he quit school in the sixth grade, racked balls in a pool hall, and did a lot of aimless hitchhiking.It wasn't until 1956, when he was 24, that he went racing full time. \"I used to race four or five times a week. I raced wherever and whenever I could,\" he said. During his tenure in the Modified and Sportsman bullrings, Isaac became one of the winningest drivers of the late 1950s and early '60s.AdvertisementHe also established new standards for being fined by NASCAR executive manager Pat Purcell. After a heated battle on the track, Isaac would tend to settle \"paybacks\" with a huge right hand. It took a few years for Purcell to break Isaac of this habit. \"He told me that I needed racing a lot more than racing needed me,\" reflected Isaac. \"Racing would do just fine without me, and if I wanted to be a racer, I'd have to get a handle on my temper.\"In 1963, a more mature Isaac broke into the NASCAR Grand National ranks driving Ford and Plymouths for Bondy Long. His impressive finishes in equipment regarded as second rate caught the eye of Ray Nichels, who headed a Dodge and Plymouth factory team. Nichels seated Isaac in a Dodge for the '64 season.Isaac won his very first start for Nichels in the 100-mile qualifying race at Daytona, nosing out Jimmy Pardue and Richard Petty in a three-car photo finish. In 19 starts during the 1964 NASCAR Grand National season, he posted five top-five finishes, including a second in the Atlanta 500.Boycotts by the automobile manufacturers marred the 1965 and '66 seasons, and Isaac was forced to sit out most of '65 while Chrysler was on the sidelines. He joined the Junior Johnson Ford team in '66 and was again trapped in a corporate dispute.Meanwhile, Nord Krauskopf, owner of the K&K Insurance Co. in Ft. Wayne, Ind., was forming his own NASCAR team. He hired Harry Hyde to turn the wrenches, and, in '67, persuaded Isaac to drive the car. Krauskopf announced a five-year plan to win the NASCAR championship.Isaac ran a partial 12-race slate in 1967 with a top finish of second at Charlotte. In '68, the K&K Dodge team entered all the races and nearly won the title. With three short-track \u00advictories, Isaac finished second to David Pearson in the final standings.\"We were basically a new team,\" said Isaac. \"Harry was relatively new to NASCAR and we didn't have any factory help that year. Getting beat by Pearson with all his experience and factory help wasn't too bad.\"In 1969, Isaac won 17 races, including his first on a superspeedway at the new Texas track, and earned 20 poles. The 20 poles in a single season remains an all-time NASCAR Cup Series record. \"We won a lot of short-track races, but we couldn't pull it all together on the big tracks until the last race of the season at Texas. That win was my biggest moment in racing,\" said Isaac.The following year, Isaac and the K&K team jelled into one of stock car racing's most formidable teams. They won 11 races and snared the championship. \"Winning the champion\u00adship gave me personal satisfaction, but I'd rank it second to the Texas win,\" said Isaac. \"The way I look at it, it took me seven years to win a superspeedway race and only three years to win the championship.\"Isaac went on to win five more races for Krauskopf's team, never again running a full schedule. In 1972, he suddenly quit the team. He never won another race.In 1973, he teamed with Bud Moore, who was developing a small engine for future use in NASCAR competition. At the '73 Talladega 500, Isaac called Moore on the radio and told him to get another driver because he was quitting. Isaac brought the car to the pits, climbed out and said he was retiring. The retirement lasted six months. From 1974 to '76, he ran only a few NASCAR Winston Cup Grand National events. During his big league NASCAR career, Isaac won 37 races in 308 starts.In the twilight of his career, Isaac was back in the saddle of a Sportsman car, competing weekly at his old Hickory Speed\u00adway stomping grounds. On the night of Aug. 13, 1977, he \u00adsuffered a heart attack after getting out of his car during a 200-lapper. He died early the next morning.Bobby Isaac elevated himself from a world of poverty to one of the most successful stock car racers in the country. He made his own way. Nobody gave him anything."},

PROBABLY PRETTY TIRED.AdvertisementSorry, I was shouting \u2014 but you knew that.These days, people use the written word to communicate more than we have in any other period in history. You can make a plan with a friend, discuss the grocery list with your spouse, and negotiate your kid's curfew without having to strain your precious, beautiful vocal cords one bit. But the problem with conversing through the written word instead of face-to-face has to do with tone. In order for your reader to get the full meaning of your 246-character text, you have to use all the tools the QWERTY keyboard has to offer. One of those tools is the caps lock key.In a two-partseries on meh., the daily-deal-retail-site-turned-internet-forum, writer and former typesetter Dave Fleishman explores the evolution of SHOUTY CAPS, and suggests the history of using all capital letters to indicate outrage or very strong, spirited emphasis is much older than our internet forefathers would have us believe.Capital letters evolved in the Roman Empire where stone cutters made inscriptions on the topmost capitals of monuments and buildings using big, straight letters. The lowercase letters evolved from adaptations of capitals that were written by hand in manuscripts. Eventually there was a crossover where the capital letters wound up being used as big illustrated centerpieces of illuminated manuscripts, and finally the two cases flirted with each other until the deal was sealed around the mid-1400's when the Gutenberg Bible became the first mass-produced book using movable type.But throughout history, capital letters were used for emphasis: the use of capitals in NO PARKING and NO SMOKING, for instance, lend the messages a certain gravitas. Newspapers used all caps for their headlines until the 1910's, when it was pointed out that capital letters are just plain exhausting to read.\"But there's a difference between shouting and signifying importance,\" says Fleishman. \"I was trying to figure out, was there a historical basis for the convention of using the uppercase to shout? A lot of things are tacit; everyone alive today who uses an online service appreciates that when you use uppercase, you're shouting. But was that true before?\"If you ask early internet users, they'd say modern use of all caps as tantamount to shouting goes back to at least March of 1984, when a guy named Dave Decot, then a computer science student at Case Western Reserve University, wrote in a forum:\u00a0Well, there seem to be some conventions developing in the use of various emphasizers. There are three kinds of emphasis in use, in order of popularity:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a01) using CAPITAL LETTERS to make words look 'louder',\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a02) using *asterisks* to put sparklers around emphasized words, and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a03) s p a c i n g words o u t, possibly accompanied by 1) or 2).This was just after computer terminals switched from all-uppercase to mixed-case keyboards, so when given the option of writing in lowercase or uppercase letters, the early internet decided all caps was great for shouting. However, if you didn't know the implications, using all caps just made you seem old.\"Anybody who persisted in using all upper case even after the switch in computer terminal keyboards seemed fussy and out-of-date because they were still using older terminals or hadn't gotten used to the new system,\" says Fleishman.But Fleishman sensed the internet didn't invent uppercase shouting, and after a protracted search, found a reference from an 1856 edition of The Evening Star, a Washington, D.C. newspaper, that recounts the tale of a Dutchman with small pox:\"'I dells you I've got der small pox. Ton't you vetsteh? der SMALL POX!' This time he shouted it out in capital letters.\"\"That's the smoking gun right there,\" says Fleishman.So, now you know and may go about your business, quietly and with good manners. All-caps-as-shouting predates the American Civil War, toilet paper, the machine gun, pencil erasers and postcards.A campaign began in Sweden in 2001 to remove the caps lock key from computer keyboards. In the early 1980's, caps lock took over the keyboard real estate where the control key used to be. These days, CAPSoff.org advocates for the removal of \"this ludicrous key.\""},

It's easy to carry small things around without breaking a sweat; you might even be able to toss them from one hand to the other. But when the weight of the object increases, the act of carrying becomes more difficult. Carrying a couch or a television, for example, is much harder than carrying a book. Your body will need to work harder and expend more energy to carry the extra weight, and chances are you'll sweat a little in the process.The same principles apply to our cars. When they're only carrying the driver, cars run easier and use less fuel. If you've packed up your car with every item from your apartment and are moving across town, you might notice the vehicle moving a bit more slowly, and your gas mileage would certainly decrease.AdvertisementWhether it's our bodies or a car engine, carrying extra weight requires extra energy, and extra energy creates excess heat. The great danger in these situations is overwork and overheating. Too much heat can damage your engine, which can lead to expensive repairs or, even worse, breakdowns on the road. The same is true for your vehicle's transmission.Tow vehicles carrying thousands of extra pounds of trailer weight do much more work than regular cars and they create lots of heat under the hood. Because of this, many people who tow install transmission coolers into their trucks, SUVs or recreational vehicles. How do they work? Is there one type of transmission cooler, or are there several different kinds to consider? How are they installed?"},

Physics tells us that energy can not be destroyed. So when your car slows down, the kinetic energy that was propelling it forward has to go somewhere. Most of it simply dissipates as heat and becomes useless. That energy, which could have been used to do work, is essentially wasted.AdvertisementIs there anything that you, the driver, can do to stop wasting this energy? Not really. In most cars it's the inevitable byproduct of braking and there's no way you can drive a car without occasionally hitting the brakes. But automotive engineers have given this problem a lot of thought and have come up with a kind of braking system that can recapture much of the car's kinetic energy and convert it into electricity, so that it can be used to recharge the car's batteries. This system is called regenerative braking.At present, these kinds of brakes are primarily found in hybrid vehicles like the Toyota Prius, and in fully electric cars, like the Tesla Roadster. In vehicles like these, keeping the battery charged is of considerable importance. However, the technology was first used in trolley cars and has subsequently found its way into such unlikely places as electric bicycles and even Formula One race cars.\u00adIn a tr\u00adaditional braking system, brake pads produce friction with the brake rotors to slow or stop the vehicle. Additional friction is produced between the slowed wheels and the surface of the road. This friction is what turns the car's kinetic energy into heat. With regenerative brakes, on the other hand, the system that drives the vehicle does the majority of the braking. When the driver steps on the brake pedal of an electric or hybrid vehicle, these types of brakes put the vehicle's electric motor into reverse mode, causing it to run backwards, thus slowing the car's wheels. While running backwards, the motor also acts as an electric generator, producing electricity that's then fed into the vehicle's batteries. These types of brakes work better at certain speeds than at others. In fact, they're most effective in stop-and-go driving situations. However, hybrids and fully electric cars also have friction brakes, as a kind of back-up system in situations where regenerative braking simply won't supply enough stopping power. In these instances, it\u2019s important for drivers to be aware of the fact that the brake pedal might respond differently to pressure. The pedal will sometimes depress farther towards the floor than it normally does and this sensation can cause momentary panic in drivers.In the following pages, we'll take a more detailed look at how a regenerative braking system works, and we'll discuss reasons why regenerative braking is more efficient than a typical friction brake system."},

"], "date": null, "content": "Imagine watching the 2016 Olympics: When shown in slow-motion, a tennis player wiping the sweat off her brow can look like a grand motion, and a gymnast's aerial move appears larger than life. Slowed video can make the boring seem exciting and the mundane seem extraordinary. But it turns out that slowing videos not only amps up the drama of a scene, but also creates bias in viewers \u2014 specifically when it comes to jury members in court cases.Video footage of crimes often plays an important role in determining a perpetrator's punishment. In some trials, jurors may watch a slow-motion video of the criminal act in question, supposedly to better analyze the events that took place. But researchers, writing that \"any benefits of video replay should be weighed against its potentially biasing effects,\" conducted a study that suggests slo-mo video doesn't always help jurors make well-informed decisions. Instead, the elongated time of the video makes it seem like the crime took longer to unfold, so jurors are more likely to perceive the action as intentional.AdvertisementWhether a jury thinks a crime was premeditated can be the difference between a second- and first-degree murder charge, so it's a matter of life and death. This was the case in the 2009 murder trial of John Lewis, which the researchers used as the basis for the study. In the trial, the prosecution showed a slow-motion video of Lewis shooting a Philadelphia police officer, and the defense argued that the stretched time made the act seem premeditated. The prosecution rebutted by pointing out that the jurors saw the video at regular speed, too.\u00a0To test whether slo-mo video actually increases perception of time and intent, the researchers conducted four studies.Study one: Participants (acting as jurors) either saw the video of Lewis slowed down or at normal speedStudy two: Tested perceived intention in an NFL video of a prohibited helmet-to-helmet tackle, as well as the effect of video duration by pausing the video instead of slowing itStudy three: Tested whether displaying and mentioning video speed decreased biasStudy four: Required participants to watch the slo-mo, followed by the regular video\u00a0Confirming the researchers' guess, showing slowed video quadrupled the odds that jurors would believe the shooter guilty of intentional murder before deliberation, assisted by the increased amount of time that jurors felt the defendant had to act. Also, viewers who watched the slow-motion tackle (the second study) were more likely to think it was premeditated \u2014 and pausing the video didn't change that. For the third study, even though viewers were repeatedly reminded it was a slow-motion video, that didn't change the results \u2014 they were the same as the first study.And the final study showed that the viewers who saw only the slo-mo version of events were 3.4 times more likely to convict that viewers who only saw the regular version. Viewers who saw both speeds were 1.5 times more likely to convict. This demonstrates that showing both speeds lessens bias but doesn't completely eliminate it.The authors admit that the study doesn't determine the effect of slowed video on the accuracy of viewers' judgment. But considering the fact that the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled the slo-mo in Lewis' case admissible and that Lewis is on death row despite his appeals, the results of this study could change how we view the role of videos in determining criminals' sentences. And with the explosion of police body cameras, surveillance cameras and smartphone video, the effect of video replay speed on jurors could have even more importance in the coming years."},

Word Crack, a Boggle-like word game, is her aptly named drug of choice. But she also uses her phone's tiny screen to read books borrowed digitally from the library (a book-a-day habit) and, of course, to FaceTime with the grandkids.My mother-in-law is in the same boat. She can tell you the local weather forecast where each of her seven children (plus 26 grandchildren) live because she compulsively checks the weather app on her smartphone. Then there's the constant stream of social media notifications from Facebook, Instagram and GroupMe. Ding, ding and ding.AdvertisementMillennials are supposed to be the ones addicted to their smartphones, not senior citizens (sorry, Mom, but you do ask for the discount at the movies). But as more and more gray-haired Americans buy and use smartphones, are they becoming just as dependent on their digital devices?In January 2017, the Pew Research Center released the latest numbers on smartphone adoption in the United States. More than three-quarters of American adults (77 percent) now own a smartphone, but the fastest growing demographic is people over 50, 74 percent of whom now own a device. That's up 16 percentage points from just two years ago. Smartphone ownership for Americans 65 and older is at 42 percent today, up 12 points from 2015.A spike in smartphone adoption is one thing, but what about the relationship that seniors have with their devices? Is it healthy? Back in 2015, when Pew asked Americans of varying ages to \"describe\" their smartphone, seniors gave overwhelmingly positive answers. Monica Anderson is a research associate at Pew and helped analyze the 2015 survey data.\"Older Americans were more likely to describe their phone as something that connected them to other people as opposed to it being a distraction,\" Anderson says. \"They were also less likely than younger groups to say they used their phone out of boredom.\"Much\u00a0has changed since Pew asked those questions in 2015. Now that smartphone adoption among Baby Boomers and seniors has spiked, will they pick up the same bad attitudes and bad habits as text-obsessed teens and social-media-enslaved millennials?Dr. David Greenfield is the founder of the Center for Internet and Technology Addiction and an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine. He wrote the prescient book \"Virtual Addiction\"\u00a0way back in 1999 and is a leading expert on internet addiction, gaming addiction and smartphone addiction. He says that older Americans are just as susceptible to the neurological triggers and traps of addictive behavior.\u00a0\"I have many patients who are in their late 50s and 60s, and a few older,\" Greenfield says. \"Based on [the Pew] statistics, it's likely that you'll see more people get into trouble with it. But I don't think you'll see the numbers become equivalent to the millennials.\"The older tech-addicted or tech-abusing patients that Greenfield sees in his clinic tend to be turning to the unrestrained access of their smartphones to feed offline addictions like shopping, gambling, stock trading and pornography. This is different than younger patients who are more likely to struggle with addictions to social media and gaming, which don't have offline equivalents.Still, Greenfield says, the smartphone has been designed to push buttons in the brain that can easily lead to compulsive behavior and even addiction in people of all ages.\"The smartphone is the world's smallest slot machine,\" says Greenfield. \"Every time you go online, you don't know what you're going to find. You don't know what kind of social media update is going to be there, what deal on shopping, what your sports score is going to be, your stock price, or what emails or texts are going to be there.\"Your brain is wired to release a pleasurable shot of dopamine when you find something novel and exciting. So, every time you hear the \"ding\" of a smartphone notification, Greenfield says it's a green light to your brain that a dopamine boost might be right around the corner, like waiting to see if that third cherry falls into place on a slot machine.\u00a0\"That's why people check their phones a hundred times a day,\" Greenfield says. \"It's incredibly addictive. Incredibly addictive.\"Both Greenfield and Anderson from Pew say that we don't have enough data yet to determine with any certainty that older Americans are anywhere near 20-somethings in their level of smartphone use (or abuse). Anderson says that Pew is currently working on a follow-up survey specifically about seniors and mobile technology.It's also tempting to dismiss smartphone addiction as a harmless if annoying compulsion. So what if grandma checks her Facebook feed during dinner? Your teenager has been doing it for years. But there are situations in which the compulsive need to check your phone can turn deadly \u2014 distracted driving.In 2014, 3,179 people were killed in accidents caused by distracted driving and 431,000 were injured. Statistics show that young people are far more likely to text or email while driving, but they're not the only ones engaging in this risky behavior.A 2012 survey by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that 2.2 percent of people 65 and older who were in a crash in the prior year reported reading a text or email at the time of the accident. For 18- to 20-year-olds, that number was 3.3 percent, but as many as 8.2 percent were sending a text when they got into a crash.Greenfield explains that young people are more likely to engage in risky behavior like distracted driving because their prefrontal cortex \u2014 the part of the brain that has to do with judgment and using past experiences to make decisions \u2014 is not fully developed until the mid-twenties.\"But our research shows that almost everybody uses their smartphone while they drive in ways that are risky, even though they know it's dangerous. We see the same behavior in adults and older adults who have the neurological capacity to make good executive decisions,\" says Greenfield.Add in the fact that older people generally have slower reflexes and response times than youngsters, and we could have a growing problem on our hands.\u00a0According to a 2015 report from Microsoft Canada, the attention span of an average human adult was down to eight seconds in 2013 (from 12 seconds in 2000). A goldfish, by comparison, has a nine-second attention span. Sure, but goldfish can't even hold a smartphone.   "},

And answering repeated calls from telemarketers or robocallers is a waste of time. While you can certainly stop answering the phone, or download call-blocking apps such as Nomorobo, there's another way to handle the problem.One way you can cut down on these unwanted calls is to block the offending phone numbers from calling you again. Most phones include a call-blocking feature. How you block a number depends on the type of phone you have.To help you figure out how to block a number with your phone, we've broken it down by the most common phone systems in use today.AdvertisementBlocking a number on an iPhone is fairly straightforward. And you can block incoming voice calls, or via FaceTime or the Messages app. Here's how:After a call comes in, tap the \"i\" icon next to the phone number (or contact) you wish to block. Scroll all the way down and select \"Block this Caller\" to complete the process.If you prefer to just avoid unwanted calls outright, you can also silence calls from unknown callers. To do this, go to \"Settings\" and select \"Phone\" and turn on \"Silence Unknown Callers.\" This option will send calls from phone numbers that aren't in your contacts directly to voicemail.AdvertisementConsidering how Android is open to customization, blocking a number can vary depending on the device and manufacturer. In general, devices running the most current version of Android can block numbers by selecting a phone number from a contact's page.When selecting a phone number, hold down on the selection to bring up a drop-down menu. From here, select \"Block/report spam\" to block the number.From a contact's page, just click on the ellipsis icon at the top of the page. Then, select \"Block Number\" from the drop-down menu.AdvertisementSince landlines don't have all the features of smartphones, the process for blocking phone numbers is dependent on third parties. That means you can either go through your phone provider or buy a call-blocking device.However, provider offers can vary greatly. Some providers may have services for blocking calls, while others may send suspicious calls directly to voicemail. Your best bet is to discuss the options with your phone company to find out what they offer.If you'd prefer not to go through your phone provider, installing a call-blocking device might be worth considering. These small devices use a directory of scam numbers to determine calls to block. If spam calls do get through, you can add the offending numbers to the directory. In addition to adding numbers, these devices allow you to create lists of approved numbers and set up \"do not disturb\" hours, where all calls go to voicemail.AdvertisementOf course, adding and blocking every single spam call can be tedious. If you want to avoid that altogether, why not just let the people making those unwanted calls know they can't? That's where the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)'s National Do Not Call Registry has you covered. According to the FTC, the Do Not Call Registry is \"a list that tells telemarketers what numbers not to call.\" Registering your number is free and all you need to do is visit the website or call 888-382-1222 to sign up. Although it only takes 24 hours for your number to be added, it can take up to 31 days for the unwanted calls to stop. Your number will stay on the Registry as long as it's active or until you request it be removed.Since the FTC has no power to block your number, you may receive calls from those who ignore the list. If you still get spam calls and you're on the Do Not Call Registry, you can file a complaint with the FTC."},

If you're going to make the effort, whether it's on a weekly schedule or when you happen to notice the dust bunnies under the bed and the fine layer of dust covering your photos, make sure you're using the right tools for the job; you want to remove dust, not just spread it around.You'll need a few cloths or rags, either microfiber cloths (dust particles are more likely to cling to this type of cloth) or soft cotton cloths to do most of the work, as well as a vacuum cleaner, broom or mop.Dust with a microfiber cloth or lightly dampened soft cloth rag. Damp-dusting will help keep dust particles sticking to the cleaning cloth instead of going airborne from being brushed around by a dry rag -- and you don't need anything more than water to get the job done.Knickknacks and clutter are dust magnets, so if you must live with your tchotchke-filled shelves, remove your collection while you're dusting and give every item a good once-over, as well, before replacing.And don't forget: Always dust from the top down to avoid sabotaging your own dusting work, and don't overlook giving your electronic equipment a light dust. Finish by vacuuming the furniture and floor (or mopping it with a damp mop if the floor isn't carpeted) to clean up any dust or debris that's collected in the corners or on the back of the sofa from your top-down dusting style -- and don't forget to clean under the bed.Bedding, too, is also a major contributor to the dust in your dorm room, and all sheets, blankets, and pillowcases should be washed in hot water -- or changed, at least -- every week. Not just four times a year, like the average single guy in his early 20s [source: Smallman].Finally, a fan-style air purifier will help reduce dust levels in your room -- and will help with odor control in general [source: U.S. EPA]."},

Engineers were more concerned more with the practical nature of engines and other mechanical aspects -- in other words, getting a car to actually work -- so this tended to overshadow most efforts in design and usability. Most auto manufacturers were simply installing engines in light carriages and buggies, fitting bicycle wheels to each of the four corners and rolling the cars out the factory door -- without much focus on luxury. Aside from the steering wheel, the pedals and occasionally a handbrake, these early cars were essentially \"horseless carriages.\" Actually, that's how a lot of people referred to them at the time. The dashboard was effectively void of any bells or whistles. In fact, the term \"dashboard\" allegedly comes from the screen people used on horse-drawn vehicles to block any water, mud or snow a horse's hooves might fling upward while \"dashing.\"In 1902, however, car interiors started to become a bit more helpful. The introduction of the speedometer put a gauge right near the steering wheel, allowing drivers to see just how fast they were traveling. We might take something as simple as a speedometer for granted today, but early in the car's history, this was really the only way to accurately monitor their speeds and drive safer. Since then, improvements to the car's interior have only increased, making the drive both safer and more comfortable. Now, we have clusters of indicators letting us know our speed, the engine's revolutions per minute (RPMs), the engine oil pressure, coolant temperature and even whether or not we've remembered to buckle our seat belt. We also have air-conditioning and heating systems that allow us to accurately control the interior's temperature -- sometimes in multiple zones.AdvertisementWith global temperatures heating up, gas prices fluctuating and drivers looking for alternatives to gasoline-only engines that give off heavy amounts of carbon emissions, many are looking toward hybrid cars -- specifically gasoline-electric hybrids -- for an environmentally and economically sound solution.Now, hybrid cars are upping the ante by giving drivers even more information with which to work. On top of traditional instrument readouts like speed and RPMs, some hybrids are using increasingly sophisticated hybrid system indicators, which inform the green-minded commuter about important statistics like real-time fuel economy and battery levels.So what do hybrid system indicators actually do to assist drivers? Do they simply give us statistics, or can they take their information a step further and help people become better, more efficient drivers? Find out on the next page."},

You can replace the hardware, but any information on your phone, including photos, recordings, documents, or saved application data will be gone forever. Even something as simple as updating the operating system could turn your expensive smartphone into a \"brick\" of silicon, glass, and metal.Fortunately, it's pretty easy to back up your iPhone, and if you get a new phone of the same type, you may be able to upload the saved files onto your new device and format it just like the old one, as long as you backed it up. iPhone users have two main options: You can save your backup to a computer, or to an iCloud account.AdvertisementIt's important to remember that syncing your phone is not the same as backing it up. While syncing saves contacts, photos, videos, songs, playlists, and podcasts, backing up saves a snapshot of your entire phone's contents to restore them. Here's how to back up your phone to your computer:Windows users must use Apple's iTunes software to back up their iPhones. Click on your iPhone in the iTunes window, and click Summary. Then click on Back Up Now, and you'll have the option to encrypt your backup.You can also back up your iPhone wirelessly using an iCloud account. Here's how:It's important to remember that the amount of storage you have on your iCloud account may limit how much you can back up. Simply put if you have the free 5 GB account and a 256 GB iPhone, you will need to pay for more storage or back up to your computer instead. Unlike computer backups, all iPhone backups to iCloud are fully encrypted for security.There are also third-party software solutions to help with Windows and Mac backups, such as Acronis True Image, iMazing, and Dr.Fone. Third-party software may offer additional backup options, including the ability to choose the location of your backups and select the parts of the backup to restore."},

", "Tetris' popularity exploded when it became the free game included with every first generation Game Boy sold in the United States in 1989."], "date": "Mar 1, 2021", "content": "For almost four decades, through Cold War and detente, through the fall of the U.S.S.R. and the rise of globalism, through diplomatic freezes and thaws and years of touch-and-go Russian-American relations, people all over the world have remained mesmerized by a Soviet invention \u2014 a computer game, of all things \u2014 that somehow has both persevered and prospered.By now, the game's ever-quickening trickle-down of four-block shapes is immediately identifiable to just about anyone who has ever signed on to a computer. When it was conceived in 1984 by a puzzle-happy programmer, though, Tetris was little more than an in-house diversion, designed to break up serious-minded,12-hour days at the Russian Academy of Sciences.From that bit of Soviet-controlled software, Tetris has evolved into maybe the most famous computer game the world has ever seen. It's a seemingly simple electronic escape that is enjoyed in more than 200 countries on more than 50 separate platforms by millions of people playing billions of games every year. Tetris has been downloaded on mobile devices alone \u2014 mobile devices mostly didn't exist when creator Alexey Pajitnov unveiled the game to his co-workers in 1984 \u2014 more than 500 million times.\"Well,\" says Pajitnov, 64, who sees his game more along the lines of chess than Minecraft or Grand Theft Auto, \"Tetris is a really good game. One of the best. That's not very modest of me. But that's the fact.\"AdvertisementPajitnov, born in Moscow, was helping to develop early speech-recognition software at the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre at the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1984 when he began building a computer game in his spare time. The game featured tetrominos \u2014 four-block playing pieces (tetra being a prefix for \"four\") that come in seven different shapes, from straight lines to squares \u2014 falling into a playing field. He called it Tetris.The game was built on, and initially played only on, an early Soviet computer, an Elektronika 60, which had no graphic capabilities. Still, with blocks of flashing lights  serving as the tetrominos, it was an instant hit with Pajitnov's colleagues.Unfortunately for the fledgling worldwide gaming population, the academy's purpose was not to build computer games.\"The Computer Centre was a pretty serious kind of institute,\" says Pajinov, speaking from his home just outside of Seattle. \"Very solid and very serious. Nobody ever thought about creating a computer game. Basically, all this was just an excuse for having fun [among the programmers].\"The game lingered for months inside the cavernous rooms at the center until Pajitnov, pushed by many of his co-workers to make it more accessible, assigned someone to import the game to the much more popular IBM PC.\"On PC, it starts its own life,\" Pajitnov says. \"It was like a forest fire. It went everywhere.\"Eventually, the game was saved onto floppy discs and leaked into other countries. What followed were years of legal and sometimes shadowy maneuvering. Those outside the Soviet Union were eager to get their hands on the game to sell it. The Soviet government, which held all rights to Pajitnov's work, resisted.At one time, a Hungarian software company thought it had secured the rights from Pajitnov to sell the game in the West. But it turned out to be a miscommunication; Pajitnov, a mere programmer in the Soviet bureaucracy, did not have the power to authorize his creation's licensing. And the Soviets declined to give up control.AdvertisementBy 1988, though, the Soviet ministry responsible for the export of computer hardware and software gave its blessing, and Tetris made its way onto PCs in the United Kingdom and the U.S. The real Tetris explosion came a year later, when a new hand-held gaming computer made by the Japanese firm Nintendo \u2014 the Game Boy \u2014 promised to include a Tetris cartridge with every unit sold in America. If the Soviets agreed.\"I made a handshake deal with Minoru Arakawa, the founder of Nintendo of America, to have Nintendo include Tetris in every Game Boy,\" Henk Rogers, a Dutch video game producer living in Japan and now president of the Tetris Company, told CNN in 2019. \"He said, 'Why should I include Tetris? I have Mario.' And I said, 'If you want little boys to buy your Game Boy, then include Mario. But if you want everyone to buy your Game Boy, then you should include Tetris.'\"The Soviets \u2014 again, still in the middle of the Cold War and suspicious of anything to do with the West \u2014 were not yet convinced. The KGB supposedly got involved. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev may have had a say. Rogers, with the lucrative deal hanging by a thread, flew to Moscow to try to convince the Soviets to sign on to the agreement. He reportedly spent hours being questioned by Soviet officials. \"I thought they were trying to figure out whether they were gonna send me to Siberia or not,\" he told CNN.The gambit worked. The Soviets agreed to a deal. Tetris, with its Soviet-themed packaging (\"From Russia With Fun!\"), became part of the Game Boy launch in 1989. Nintendo sold 35 million Game Boys that year.And Tetris boomed into a worldwide phenomenon.AdvertisementThe goal of conventional Tetris is to control where and how the tetrominos fall so that they fill up entire horizontal lines in the playing field. The completed lines are eliminated from the field, clearing more space to play. The more lines a player can completely fill and eliminate before the tetrominos (Tetris calls its tetrominos \"Tetriminos\") pile up to the top of the playing field \u2014 something gamers call \"topping out\" \u2014 the higher the score.It sounds simple. And, on the most basic level, it is. But that's part of the beauty of Tetris.\"Tetris is very deceptive. It creates lots of illusions in the players' minds. It seems to be very simple, but it is not,\" Pajitnov says. \"You have an extremely long learning curve. The normal [video game], you have 30-40 hours learning curve. Tetris, to my kind of thinking, is 120 hours.\"Add to that, Pajitnov says, is the idea that Tetris is a puzzle. \"There is no puzzle,\" Pajitnov says. \"What you see is what you get.\"In many ways, the game is so simple that it's nearly mystical; so easy it's seldom mastered.Tetris is one of the most-awarded games in history and has had numerous spinoffs over the years, all of them now licensed by The Tetris Company. The game, in its various forms, is played on iPhones, Android smartphones, Nintendo systems, XBox, Playstation, on Apple and Windows desktop and laptop computers, on tablets, and on many other devices and platforms, including virtual reality headsets like the Oculus.An annual tournament that features the 1989 version of Tetris on the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Classic Tetris World Championships, is normally held in Portland every year (it was held virtually in 2020).Through all those years of push and pull with the game, Pajitnov may have missed out on potentially millions of dollars in royalties. But he is content with what he has created and convinced of its lasting worth.\"At some moment, I had a choice, either start to fight for my rights, and spend the rest of my life fighting ... I decide that if God give me such a gift to create such a game, I will create another game and go about it another way,\" says Pajitnov, who has developed many other games, including Tetris-type games like Welltris and Hatris. \"The most important thing is to give this game to the people.\"Completing its journey to the top of pop culture iconography, Tetris will be featured in an upcoming Apple movie starring Taron Egerton (who portrayed Elton John in 2019's \"Rocketman\"). In \"Tetris: The Movie,\" Egerton will play Rogers, the man who secured the global rights to Tetris on video game consoles. Filming is currently taking place in Scotland."},

Kiger", "image": "https://resize.hswstatic.com/w_828/gif/airplane-mode-1.jpg", "image_content": ["Do cellphones really need to be in airplane mode on planes? "], "date": "Mar 17, 2021", "content": "Mobile phones have become an integral part of modern existence, making it possible for us to call or text other people from anywhere. Or rather, from almost anywhere. One of the places where federal regulations bar you from using your phone \u2014 or rather, its capability to connect to a phone company's cellular network for voice and data \u2014 is while you're flying on a U.S. airliner.Using a phone on to connect to a cellular network while on an airline flight actually is prohibited by not just one but two different parts of the U.S. government.AdvertisementThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has long prohibited the use of phones and other devices to connect with cellular networks, because of what it says is the potential for those electronic gadgets to interfere with aircraft navigation and communication systems. In 2013, the FAA did soften that stance slightly, allowing the use of mobile devices in airplane mode, in which the phone's ability to transmit radio signals to cell towers is turned off, as long as airlines could show that it wouldn't interfere with a plane's electronics. (In airplane mode, the ability to call and text is turned off. WiFi and Bluetooth access are also turned off but you can turn them on separately while still remaining in airplane mode.)Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which regulates mobile phones, banned airline passengers in 1991 from making calls in flight, out of concern that those signals would interfere with communications networks on the ground. That prohibition is still in force, though in recent years the FCC considered \u2014 but then rejected in November 2020 \u2014 a proposal to allow a technology that would have permitted passengers to make cellular calls without creating interference. (More on why later.)So, is it really necessary to ban cellphone use on airline flights? Researchers in the mid-2000s concluded that phones did have the potential to interfere with critical electronics in aircraft, though they couldn't find any instances in which it had caused an accident, as this 2006 IEEE Spectrum article details.Sven Bil\u00e9n, a professor of engineering design, electrical engineering, and aerospace engineering at Penn State University, says that phones aren't as much of a safety issue as they once might have been.\"Most planes nowadays are hardened,\" explains Bil\u00e9n, who wrote an article about cellphones on aircraft for The Conversation in 2018. \"There's always the possibility of some adverse interaction, but it's essentially a risk that the companies have tried to mitigate by hardening their electronics, by putting shielding around them.\" Shielding or hardening means to surround the airplane's electronics (like the flight control systems) with an electrically conductive material to prevent electromagnetic interference from computers and cellphones.There's pretty good evidence that such protection works, because as Bil\u00e9n notes, there probably are plenty of passengers who don't turn off their phones' cellular connections, sometimes unintentionally, even after flight attendants remind them before takeoff.\"If there were major problems, we'd see planes falling out of the sky,\" Bil\u00e9n says.But that doesn't mean you can just ignore the ban.\"We are not aware of any technology that enables airline crews to identify someone who may be trying to make an in-flight call with a cellular phone,\" an FAA representative explains via email. That said, if you try to make a call, you're likely to get caught, because \"cabin crews or other passengers likely would be able to see whether a passenger is talking on a phone while a plane is airborne,\" the representative added.The potential of cellphones to interfere with ground networks is probably more of a potential problem these days, according to Bil\u00e9n. A bunch of people making calls while moving rapidly through the air theoretically could be pinging cell towers all over the places, taxing their ability to process and hand off the calls to the next cell in the network.In practice, at normal cruising altitude of 36,000 feet (11 kilometers) \"if you do have your cell connection on in the air, you probably won't get any cell towers,\" Bil\u00e9n says. \"The cell towers don't expect there to be traffic in the air, so their radiation patterns are focused on the ground.\" It's probably only when planes descend to less than 10,000 feet (3 kilometers), as they get closer to landing, that passengers could flip on their phones, connect and cause interference.So, how is it that some planes offer cellphone service on board? There's a technology that allows passengers to make calls without the risk of interfering with the plane's electronics or ground networks. As Bil\u00e9n details in his article, picocells \u2014 basically, a miniature, low-power cell tower installed on the plane \u2014 allow calls to be transmitted over the aircraft's internet connection. Since the early 2010s, Virgin Atlantic, a British airline, has provided in-flight mobile service using that technology. But the service is discontinued once an aircraft is within 250 miles (402 kilometers) of the U.S. border.Even though it's technologically feasible, don't expect to be able to make cellphone calls on a U.S. airline flight anytime soon. The FCC spent seven years considering a rule change that would have allowed cellphone service on flights, but ultimately abandoned the idea, after it faced intense opposition from a wide range of groups, ranging from flight attendants and machinists and aerospace workers to federal law enforcement officers. As this 2014 comment details, one concern was that phones might be used by terrorists to detonate explosive devices. Another criticism was that if passengers had phones pressed to their ears, they might not hear important safety instructions from flight attendants.Others objected because they saw passengers talking on phones as an annoyance inside the cramped confines of an airliner. \"The last thing any of us need during a flight is to be treated to the loud conversations of others while we're trying to read/sleep/converse quietly with a companion,\"  one commenter wrote.Bil\u00e9n, who says he uses plane flights to go through his emails and respond to them, agrees with that view. \"The whole idea of someone yapping next to you \u2014 that would drive me nuts,\" he says.A 2016 study by an in-flight internet service provider found that only 49 percent of U.S. and Canadian air travelers actually wanted the ability make mobile voice calls during flights, though 73 percent of people from other parts of the world were interested in it."},

What are all those letters? And how on earth can any race worth the track time be carbon-free?Let's start with TTXGP. The race circuit itself is called the Isle of Man TT, where \"TT\" stands for Time Trial. Almost ever since they were invented, motorcycles have raced on the Isle of Man -- an island located between Great Britain and Ireland. The first race was in 1907, and the races have continued almost uninterrupted for a century. The course used by motorcycle racers today is 37.75 miles (60.8 kilometers) long, and has corners and curves named things like Cronk-y-Voddy and Kate's Cottage. Race bikes have set dozens of records at the Isle of Man TT over the years. The fastest lap (so far) was turned in about 17 minutes, and the fastest speed was clocked at 130 miles per hour (209.2 kilometers per hour).AdvertisementThe \"X\" in TTXGP stands for extreme. This refers not only to the idea of racing motorcycles on a twisty road course in the first place, but also to the fact that every motorcycle in this series is carbon-free. Since no petroleum-based fuels are allowed, all the bikes so far have been battery-powered electric models, but as green technology advances, other fuels will likely be seen on the track.Lastly, the GP stands for Grand Prix, just as it does in other race series'. It's French for grand prize, the title and trophy that all the competitors are vying for.So there you have it, TTXGP: A circuit name, an extreme fuel and fame and glory for the winner. But how and when did it all come together in the first place?"},

It is even more remarkable considering Lloyd Seay never competed in a NASCAR race. He was murdered nearly eight years before NASCAR was \u00adincorporated.\"I raced against Lloyd before the war,\" France said in 1984. \"He was the best pure driver I ever saw, and I have seen 'em all.\"AdvertisementSeay was born in the north Georgia hills on Dec. 14, 1919. An adventurous sort, Seay grew up on the rough side of the tracks and hung around the lawless characters of his rural \u00adsurroundings.NASCAR Image GalleryIn his early teens, Seay became involved in whiskey tripping, transporting \"hooch\" from one point to another -- usually with the police and revenue agents in hot pursuit. His exploits behind the wheel of a car on the twisting switch\u00adback roads of Georgia became legend. \"He was wide open all the way,\" said Raymond Parks, a tycoon among race-team owners before and immediately after the war.Stock car racers of the time dealt in thrills and spills, defying sanity and logic. Seay's ability to hang a car on the edge made him an instant threat to win races, particularly with the support of Parks and Red Vogt, the game's top mechanic. At the age of 18, Seay entered his first stock car race at Atlanta's Lakewood Speedway -- and prevailed.A hard-boiled speed merchant, Seay's rise to stardom was meteoric; success was a constant companion. He could find as many ways to win as there were opportunities.In 1941, Seay won three races of national importance. In the Aug. 24 race on Daytona's Beach-Road course, Seay bolted from his 15th starting position to lead the opening lap. He romped to victory, finishing 31/2 miles ahead of runner-up Joe Littlejohn. Seay then won with ease at High Point, N.C., on Aug. 31.Next, Seay packed up and headed for his home in Atlanta and the annual championship event at Lakewood Speedway on Labor Day, Sept. 1. Seay started near the back of the field, having missed qualifications while in North Carolina. By the 35th lap, he had grabbed first place. Seay outran the field the rest of the way to post his third win in nine days.Only hours after accepting accolades for winning one of stock car racing's most sought-after prizes, Lloyd Seay was shot to death by his cousin, Woodrow Anderson. According to police reports, the two got into an argument over some sugar Seay purchased on Anderson's credit.Raymond Parks, who admired the youngster and had provided him with a speedy race car, arranged for an unusual tombstone to rest over Seay's burial place. Seay's famous #7 Ford coupe was engraved in relief and the driver's window was carved out. Inserted in its place was a photo of Seay, mounted in a crystal cube.Largely unknown today, Lloyd Seay generated excitement and showed fans what stock car racing was all about simply by how he drove a race car. The moment when he geared up for the start of a race brought out his electric, elegant best."},

However, that $12.99 a month price, or $119.99 per year, can be too much for those who aren't using the service to its fullest.Fortunately, Amazon does offer a full refund to Prime members within three business days of signing up or who haven't used their benefits. Even better, Amazon promises that the refund will take only three to five business days to process. But, be aware that you cannot get a refund if you used any benefits or used a gift code or promotional code to get Prime.However, you don't need to worry about these restrictions if you're still on a 30-day free trial. You just need to cancel before the trial is up to avoid a charge. Also, don't worry about canceling early as you will keep Prime benefits for the entire trial period.So, if you're looking to cancel your Amazon Prime or make sure the benefits end with your trial, here are the steps you need to take.AdvertisementFirst, you need to make sure to sign into your Amazon account.

After winning a couple of local championships, he captured the United States Auto Club (USAC) Rookie of the Year award in 1979 and the American Speed Association (ASA) championship four years later.In his very first NASCAR race at the Atlanta 500 in 1980, Rusty drove his Chevrolet to a second-place finish, taking the checkered flag just 10 seconds behind winner Dale Earnhardt -- an amazing feat for a rookie driver.AdvertisementAfter just a handful of starts in '81 and '82, and none in '83, Rusty began racing on the NASCAR circuit full time in 1984. He scored his first win in the Valleydale 500 at Bristol in 1986 and added a second that year at the Goody's 500 in Martinsville. He scored two more wins during the '87 season, then went on a tear: six victories in 1988, when he came in second behind Bill Elliott in the championship race, and six more in '89, when he came in second to no one.After his championship season, Rusty added two wins each in 1990 and '91, and one more in 1992.But in many ways, Rusty's best years were yet to come. He managed a career-high 10 wins in 1993, when he was runner-up to Earnhardt for the championship. His eight victories the following year left him third in the championship race. Rusty scored 15 more wins from 1995 to 2002, and though he never won another championship, he was in the top ten in points every year.Rusty won his final race in 2004 at Martinsville Speedway. Later that year he announced that 2005 would be his last full season, and his last year on the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup circuit. Though many drivers of his status race part-time before fading away completely, Rusty wasn't planning on fading away just yet.During the 2006 race season, Rusty covered Indy Racing League (IRL) open wheel racing as a television announcer for The Walt Disney Company networks, where his assignments included coverage of the prestigious Indianapolis 500.Besides his broadcasting gig, Rusty also runs Rusty Wallace, Inc., which campaigns a NASCAR Busch series car co-driven by his son, Steve Wallace. With any luck, Steve will advance to the NASCAR NEXTEL Cup series, where he'll have a chance to try and match his father's 55 career wins. Talk about big shoes to fill..."},

Now, you can send funds back and forth on your phone using Cash App. It's a platform that allows you to send, save and even invest your money.Cash App is a convenient service that's free and easy to use. Since being launched in 2013 by Square Inc., Business Insider reports the app has accumulated more than 24 million monthly active users. Haven't used Cash App before? No problem. We'll walk you through everything a beginner needs to know about Cash App.AdvertisementCash App is a peer-to-peer payment service that allows you to send, receive and request money. The money will appear in your Cash App account as credit. Another option is linking your account to an existing bank card and using it to transfer money to and from your Cash App account. Cash App is similar to other free money transferring apps like Venmo, Zelle, Dwolla and PayPal.Companies pay Cash App particular fees so customers can use their phones to pay for goods and services. It's essentially a digital wallet that eliminates the need for cash or traditional credit cards. Although you're only able to spend $250 within a seven-day period and receive up to $1,000 within a 30-day period, your limits can be increased by verifying your identity.Similar to other money services, Cash App will charge you a 3 percent fee for sending money via credit card. You will also be charged a 1.5 percent fee when opting for instant transfers from the app to your bank account. Luckily, this charge is avoidable by waiting two to three days through a standard transfer process.All information that's submitted to Cash App is securely encrypted to servers, so it's safe for you to use on private or public internet connections. The app also can detect if fraudulent activity is happening to your account. Users can add extra safety to their account by enabling a security lock in order to make payments.Cash App takes its financial services one step further and allows users to purchase cryptocurrency and trade stocks commission-free. You can invest as little as $1 into stocks and easily convert your dollars to Bitcoin with a few taps in the app. Additionally, you can track the BTC price, stock prices and monitor your overall investment portfolio in real time through the app."},

The idea behind the tags, though, is simple enough: to try to give a name to those who want to limit the role of digital media in their lives.These are the serious unpluggers \u2014 the so-called digital detoxifiers \u2014 the ones who want to, in the words of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, take the ever-connected \"complexifiers\" out of their lives. Those who not only want to rid themselves of Facebook, but Apple and/or Microsoft and/or Google and/or other digital boogeymen, too.That's a radical and scary idea for millions. No email. No Twitter. No online calendars. No cat videos. No memes, even.But those who make the leap \u2014 even for a short time and maybe not even as radically as the vegetarians/vegans \u2014 are compelled to do so for two main reasons: One, unplugging seems good for your health, mental and otherwise. And two, it's a good way to see just how scary staying completely plugged in really is.AdvertisementWith all the bad press around Facebook in the past few years, it's not surprising that the super plugged-in among us are starting to worry about what all that connectivity is really costing us. Privacy is a huge concern. The internet behemoths know a lot about you if you spend any time online at all \u2014 where you bank, where you shop, what you like, what your politics are, who's on your friend list, etc.That may not seem like a big deal to a grandma in Iowa or a high school student in Florida. But don't fool yourself: We're all in this interconnected world together. People are looking. At everybody.\"For a lot of people, the government really and truly is not after you. And you have bigger fish to fry in your life,\" says Gennie Gebhart, the associate director of research for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which touts itself as the leading nonprofit defending digital privacy, free speech and innovation. \"One thing I tell people is that you're not worried that the government is coming after you. But they may be coming after journalists and dissidents and community organizers, who we all need.\"So things like adopting an end-to-end encrypted messenger, for example \u2014 'I don't need that. I don't care.' \u2014 when we use that stuff, you're protecting everybody who also needs that ... If we all use it, who can say whether that end-to-end encrypted message is a highly valuable secret or just me texting my grocery list to my partner? Everything gets much harder for those folks who might be trying to put down those vulnerable people in society.\"AdvertisementPrivacy concerns are reason enough for many people to take precautions, including the recent call to delete Facebook. Kashmir Hill, a reporter and editor for the Gizmodo Media Group, recently completed a multi-part series entitled \"Goodbye Big Five.\" In it, she tried to cut the \"Big Five\" \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft \u2014 completely out of her life, one a week and, then, all at once.She used a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to keep those companies from tracking her online movements. She ditched her MacBook Airs and her iPhone for a Linux laptop and a tiny Nokia non-smartphone. (She texted using a number keypad!) She had to give up her browser of choice, her regular email, her contact lists and a good chunk of the internet that is hosted on Amazon servers. Ridding herself of the Big Five, she writes, was \"the digital equivalent of a juice cleanse.\" From the introduction to her series:The headline on her last piece in the series sums up her experience: \"I Cut the 'Big Five' Tech Giants From My Life. It was Hell\".\"It is, for the average person, practically impossible to fully quit,\" Gebhart says, which Hill made painfully evident in her series. In reality, it probably isn't even advisable. \"The more practical lesson is that there are a lot of opportunities to scale back,\" Gebhart says. \"There are a lot of opportunities to think about exactly where you intersect with different companies and scale it back to where it makes sense for you.\"AdvertisementAnother reason many give for avoiding the tech giants, or detoxifying their digital lives \u2014 besides the whole privacy issue \u2014 is that unplugging can just feel good. It can, many believe, be good for you.For years, Mary Gomes has included a \"digital fast\" in her psychology classes at Sonoma State University. She instructs her undergraduates to step away from the screens and put the smart phones down, if not 24/7, at least as much as it makes sense for them in the four days of the fast.\"What I often find is that there's a mix of trepidation, for some, and interest, cautious excitement for others ... sometimes both in the same person,\" Gomes says. \"I really go to a lot of effort to put them at ease ... By the end of the experiment, most people are literally thanking me.\"Research has pointed out the damage that too much screen use can do to person-to-person communication.   (\"[M]obile communication devices such as phones may, by their mere presence, paradoxically hold the potential to facilitate as well as to disrupt human bonding and intimacy,\" one 2012 study found). Other research has discovered how screen time, especially before bed, can disrupt a body's circadian rhythm and affect sleep.Gomes listed other pluses of at least temporarily unplugging (being more in the moment, better productivity, a chance to break the habit) in a story for the University of California Berkeley's Greater Good Magazine. She continues to include a media fast in her classes. \"I love it. I really do. It feels like there's such a clear purpose for doing this,\" she says.People all over are discovering the benefits of getting off the digital grid. There's Screen-Free Week (April 29-May 5 this year). There's the National Day of Unplugging before that (March 1-2). There are others.Americans, according to Nielsen, spend more than 10.5 hours a day on media. Some of us may check our phones, evidently, some 200 times a day. Is it time for an unplug once in a while, given all the dangers out there?\"I think really the biggest concern I have is how it makes them unaware of all the other options they have. What they could be doing with their attention,\" Gomes says of her students. \"It's more in the missed opportunities.\"Checking email continues to be a digital time suck for many of us, and we'll do it whenever \u2014 and wherever \u2014 we can. According to an Adobe survey, 28 percent of us have scrolled through our work email while in the bathroom. Of course, 40 percent of us have used that spot to look at our personal email, too. Sadly, almost half of us take a peek at work emails, at least occasionally, while on vacation."},

As always, \"Indian Red\" was a popular color choice, though others, including two-tones, were available.AdvertisementNew for the 1946 Indian Chief motorcycle however were girder-style could-spring forks adopted from Indian's radical 841 model that had been designed for desert use by the U.S. military during the war.These new forks provided a full five inches of wheel travel versus the meager two inches allowed by the previous leaf-spring design.Though the rear still featured the same plunger-type suspension, spring rates were softened. These changes resulted in an even smoother ride than before, a notable selling feature of the postwar models.Another accessory was a spring-mounted sidecar, first offered in 1940, which carried fancy chrome speedlines and trim.Go to the next page to see more pictures of the legendary 1946 Indian Chief motorcycle."},

Likewise, it could also be used to deliver the car when the work was completed.Over the years, Servi-Cars have been used for all sorts of chores, one of the more common being for parking enforcement. Our featured example was purchased by the Milwaukee Police Department for just that purpose. Note the chalk stick attached to the box behind the seat. Since cars were parked on the right (and therefore the officer would be wielding the stick in his right hand), the throttle is on the left. That necessitated moving the shifter to the right, so this vehicle is set up just the opposite of most.Servi-Cars were powered by the 45-cubic-inch flathead V-twin and normally fitted with a three-speed transmission with reverse.The '64 model was the first Harley with electric starting. They remained in production through 1973, carrying the old 45 flathead to the end."},

The color palette took on a younger look, borrowing high-impact hues like Plum Crazy and Go-Mango from the new Challenger. New front seats were the car's first to qualify as true buckets, and a hip pistol-grip handle now topped the available four-speed's Hurst shifter.Carried over was the extra-cost SE (Special Edition) group with its leather upholstery. And for the first time, Charger could be optioned with an electric sliding sunroof.Again standard on the R/T was the 375-bhp 440-cid four-barrel, but for those who didn't wish to shell out another $648 for the 425-bhp 426 Hemi, there was a new choice, the 390-bhp 440 with a trio of Holley two-barrels. It cost and upkeep were friendlier than the Hemi's, torque was identical (at 800 less rpm), and in a street fight, few big cars were tougher than a 440 Six Pack. King Kong itself grew more accommodating with the addition of hydraulic lifters, which were better than solid tappets at maintaining the valve lash so essential for good Hemi performance.Still, being fast with a Hemi required keeping all four carburetor barrels from opening until the tires hooked up. Not every driver was so skillful. \"If you were Hemi hunting in a lesser car, you wanted to catch him at a stop,\" explained Patrick Bedard in his 1990 Car and Driver \"street warriors\" retrospective. \"If he fumbled and you were lucky enough to pull out a fender-length on him, you claimed victory early by backing off the power, thereby ending the run. If you were crazy enough to stay on it, the Hemi would take over in short order.\"No Charger offered a broader array of thrills and frills than the 70. But rising insurance rates and tougher competition caused R/T sales to fall 50 percent, to 10,337, for the model year. With 116 orders, the new Six Pack outsold the Hemi by more than two to one.Return to Classic Muscle Cars Library.Check out these profiles of muscle cars, which include photos and specifications for each model:For related car information, see these articles:SpecificationsWheelbase, inches: 117.0Weight, lbs: 3,800Number built: 112Base price: $4,360Standard EngineType: ohv V-8Displacement, cid: 426Fuel system: 2 x 4bbl.Compression ratio: 10.25:1Horsepower @ rpm: 425 @ 5000Torque @ rpm: 490 @ 4000Representative Performance0-60 mph, sec: 5.51/4 mile, sec. @ mph: 13.9 @ 105"}
